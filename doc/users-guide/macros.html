  run with a single menu item selection, keystroke, or tool bar

>  Macros are written in the <I

  scripting language.
  While this section will only cover basic uses of BeanShell, macros are
  by no means limited to what is described here; BeanShell is
  a complete programming language, and your imagination is the limit to
  what macros can do. A full description of BeanShell can be found at

>   Macros are files with the extension ".bsh" and are stored in
   the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>macros</TT
> subdirectory
   of the jEdit install directory or the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>macros</TT
>
   subdirectory of the jEdit settings directory. The location of the
   settings directory is system-specific; see
   <A
HREF="settings-directory.html"
>the section called <I
>The jEdit Settings Directory</I
> in Chapter 6</A
> for details.
  </P
><P
>   The <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Macros</SPAN
> menu lists all known macros, in addition
   to commands for working with them. To play a macro, select it from
   the menu. A large macro collection can be organized by creating
   subdirectories
   in the macros directory; they
   are displayed as submenus in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Macros</SPAN
> menu.
   The menu is automatically
   refreshed when macro files are created, deleted or renamed from within jEdit.
   Because macros are ordinary files, they can also be renamed and
   deleted with your operating system's file manager. The
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Macros</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Rescan Macros</SPAN
> command must be
   invoked to update the macros menu if changes are made in a program other
   than jEdit.
  </P
><P
>   Like most other menu item commands, macros can be assigned keyboard
   shortcuts and added to the right-click context menu or tool bar in
   the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
> dialog box.
