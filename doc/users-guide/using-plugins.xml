  plugins. Usage instructions for individual plugins can be found in the

   of the jEdit settings directory. The location of the setting
   directory is operating system-specific; see <xref
   linkend="settings-directory" />.

   their names. Clicking <guibutton>Install</guibutton> will begin
   downloading the updated plugins.
