>   To improve responsiveness and percieved performance,
   jEdit executes all input/output operations asynchronously.
   While I/O is in progress, a small disk icon is displayed in the menu bar,
   in addition to progress meters for each running operation.
   The <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>I/O Progress Monitor</SPAN
> command
   displays a window with more detailed status information. Requests
   can also be aborted in this window. Note that aborting a buffer save can
   result in data loss.
  </P
><P
>   By default, four I/O threads are created, which means that up
   to four buffers can be loaded or saved simultaneously. The number of
   threads can be changed in the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Loading and Saving</SPAN
> pane of the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
> dialog box.
   Setting the number to zero disables multithreaded I/O completely; doing
   this is not recommended.
