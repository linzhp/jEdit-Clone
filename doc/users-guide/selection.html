   two locations in a buffer, or it can cover a rectangular area.

>   It is possible to select a rectangle with zero width but non-zero height.
   This can be used to insert a new column between two existing
   columns. Such zero-width selections are shown as a thin
   vertical line.
  </P
><P
>   Deleting, replacing, copying, pasting, and so on works
   as expected on rectangles. All built in commands are rectangle-aware;
   however, some plugins might not be. Note that because rectangular
   selections are implemented using character offsets, rather than
   absolute screen positions, they might not behave as one might expect
   when proportional-width fonts or tabs are used. For best results
   use monospaced fonts and soft tabs when editing columnar files.
