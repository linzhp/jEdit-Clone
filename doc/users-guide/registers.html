   position for later use.
   Each register has a single-character name; hence the number of available
   registers is limited by how many keys can be typed on your keyboard.
   Register contents are global to the editor; all buffers and views share
   the same set. Registers are not persistent and their contents are lost when
   jEdit exits. The register
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>$</TT
> is an alias for the clipboard, and therefore registers can
   be considered as an extension of the clipboard concept.

   viewing register contents. The popup menu lists all defined registers;
   selecting one will display its contents and type (text or position).
   It is not possible to change or add registers in this
   dialog box; it is only for viewing.

    reads the next character entered at the keyboard, and stores the current
    buffer name and caret position in that register. Because buffer names
    are saved in position registers, you can use them to quickly flip between
    multiple buffers.

    to the saved position.

    reads the next character entered at the keyboard, and creates a selection
    from the current caret position to the offset specified in that register.
    Keep in mind that if the register points to a different buffer than the
    current one, the resulting selection will most likely be meaningless.

    reads the next character entered at the keyboard, and swaps the caret
    position and current buffer with that entered in the register. If invoked
    repeatedly, it can be used to flip between two buffers and/or caret
    positions.
