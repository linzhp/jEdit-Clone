>  This chapter describes jEdit's basic features, such as
  opening, saving, printing and simple editing.
  jEdit works in a similar fashion to most MacOS or Windows text
  editors; if you have used one before, you will be able to start
  using jEdit immediately.

NAME="STARTING"
>Starting jEdit</A
></H1
><P
>   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on your operating system;
   most often you would type "jedit" at the command line
   or double click on the jEdit icon (or select it from a menu,
   or whatever). jEdit will open any files specified on the command line
   or dropped onto its icon. It is also possible to specify a line or marker
   to locate the caret on from the command line; see <A
HREF="cli-usage.html"
>Appendix A</A
>.
   If no initial file names are given, jEdit will load any files that
   were open in the previous session.
  </P
><P
>   Once started, jEdit will display a "splash
   screen" with the jEdit logo and a progress bar that advances
   while jEdit loads.

>    The first time jEdit is run, it will display an "initial setup
    wizard" which will help you configure firewall settings (so
    that jEdit features that make HTTP connections will work), install
    plugins using the plugin manager (see <A
HREF="plugins.html"
>Chapter 10</A
> for
    more information about plugins) and give you some pointers to
    further information. Similarly, after upgrading to a new jEdit version,
    an "update wizard" will help you update your plugins and
    give pointers to the change log so you can see what's new.
   </P
><P
>    Both of these wizards are self-explanatory and very easy to use,
    and therefore will not be covered in any more detail in this manual.

>   After jEdit has finished loading, the editor window will
   appear. Most user interface elements will look familiar
   to Windows or MacOS users, except for the text area, which has
   some unique features.
   The text area displays the contents of the currently opened buffer.
   The two scroll bars can be used to move around the buffer when there
   is more text than can fit on the screen. The blinking red line
   is called the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>caret</I
>. All text insertion and
   deletion is performed at the caret position.
  </P
><P
>   Notice how the line with the caret is highlighted, and a
   faint blue dot appears at the end of each line. The current line highlighting
   aids in locating the caret, and the dot is an <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>end of
   line marker</I
>.
  </P
><P
>   The text area never allows the caret to be positioned closer than 3 lines
   to the top or bottom of the viewscreen. If an attempt is made to move
   it there, it will scroll in the appropriate direction to
   make 3 lines above and below the caret
   visible. Having some "context" always visible helps when
   programming, for example. This feature
   is called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>electric scrolling</I
>.
  </P
><P
>   Clicking the text area with the right mouse button will
   display a menu of frequently-used
   editing commands. This menu can be edited in
   the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
> dialog box;
   see <A
HREF="global-opts.html"
>the section called <I
>The Global Options Dialog Box</I
> in Chapter 9</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   The status bar at the bottom of the editor window displays useful
   information such as the current caret location, status messages
   issued by commands,
   and the state of the current buffer (modified since last save, read only, etc).
   The caret location is displayed in the following format:
