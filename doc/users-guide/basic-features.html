>  This chapter describes jEdit's basic features, such as
  opening, saving, printing and simple editing.
  jEdit works in a similar fashion to most MacOS or Windows text
  editors; if you have used one before, you will be able to start
  working in jEdit immediately.

NAME="STARTING"
>Starting jEdit</A
></H1
><P
>   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on your operating system;
   most often you would type "jedit" at the command line
   or double click on the jEdit icon (or select it from a menu,
   or whatever). jEdit will open any files specified on the command line
   or dropped onto its icon. It is also possible to specify a line or marker
   to locate the caret on from the command line; see <A
HREF="cli-usage.html"
>Appendix C</A
>.
   If no initial file names are given, jEdit will load any files that
   were open in the previous session.
  </P
><P
>   Once started, jEdit will display a "splash
   screen" with the jEdit logo and a progress bar that advances
   while jEdit loads.

>    The first time jEdit is run, it will display an "initial setup
    wizard" which will help you configure firewall settings (so
    that jEdit features that make HTTP connections will work), install
    plugins using the plugin manager (see <A
HREF="plugins.html"
>Chapter 10</A
> for
    more information about plugins) and give you some pointers to
    further information. Similarly, after upgrading to a new jEdit version,
    an "update wizard" will help you update your plugins and
    give pointers to the change log so you can see what's new.
   </P
><P
>    Both of these wizards are self-explanatory and very easy to use,
    and therefore will not be covered in any more detail in this manual.

>   After jEdit has finished loading, the editor window will
   appear. The row of icons, or the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>tool bar</I
>, offers quick access
   to frequently used commands. In addition, clicking on the text area with
   the right mouse button will display a popup menu, also offering fast
   access to various commands. Both the tool bar and context menu can be
   customized in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
>
   dialog box; see <A
HREF="global-opts.html"
>the section called <I
>The Global Options Dialog Box</I
> in Chapter 9</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   To aid in locating the caret, the current line is drawn with a slightly
   different background color. For the pedantic programmers among us,
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>end of line markers</I
> at the end of each line are helpful for
   locating lines with trailing whitespace.
   Moving the caret closer than three lines from the top or bottom of the
   viewscreen will scroll the text area to make at least three lines above
   and below the caret visible. Having some "context" always visible
   helps when programming. This
   feature is called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>electric scrolling</I
>.
  </P
><P
>   Many aspects of the text area's operation can be customized to your liking
   in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
> dialog box;
   see <A
HREF="global-opts.html"
>the section called <I
>The Global Options Dialog Box</I
> in Chapter 9</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   The status bar at the bottom of the editor window displays useful
   information such as the current caret location, status messages
   issued by commands,
   and the state of the current buffer.
   The caret location is displayed in the following format:
