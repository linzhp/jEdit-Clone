>   One last thing that every user of jEdit should know about is the
   "activity log". The activity log is very useful for
   plugin developers, and when troubleshooting.
   jEdit writes the following information to the activity log:
  </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>All error messages and runtime exceptions (most of
   these display dialog boxes, as well; but the activity log usually
   contains more detailed information)
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Information about your Java implementation (version,
   operating system, architecture, etc)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Information about loaded plugins</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Messages when files are opened and closed. This
   can be useful in determining what caused an exception</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The directory list search logs all file names that
   will be searched</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Some plugins may log additional information as
   well</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Activity Log</SPAN
> displays a
   window showing the last 500 lines of the activity log. The complete
   log can be found in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>activity.log</TT
> file inside the
   jEdit settings directory, the path of which is system-specific and
   is shown inside the activity log window.
  </P
><P
>   While jEdit is running, the log file on disk may not always accurately reflect
   what has been logged, due to buffering done for performance reasons.
   To ensure the file on disk is up to
   date, invoke the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Update Activity
   Log on Disk</SPAN
> command. The log file is also automatically updated on
   disk when jEdit exits.
