>   jEdit doesn't deal with disk files directly. Instead, it passes all
   buffer loading and saving through one of several available storage
   implementations known as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>virtual filesystems</I
>.
   The jEdit core includes local, FTP and URL filesystems. Plugins can
   be written to add more.

    the one that ships with Java. Unlike the default implementation, it
    supports non-anonymous logins and allows
    you to browse remote filesystems.

CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"

    on a directory in the list to browse its contents; double-click on
    a file to open it. The <SPAN

    files.

><P
>    Java's networking library provides bare-bones
    implementations of HTTP, Gopher and a few other protocols, so jEdit can
    also access remote files on non-FTP servers, albeit in a much more limited
    fashion.
    To open a URL, enter it in the
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Open Path</SPAN
> dialog box. Currently,
    saving to non-FTP URLs is not supported (this is a limitation of Java's
    networking library).
