   buffer loading and saving through one of several available storage
   implementations known as <I

   The jEdit core includes local, FTP and URL filesystems. Plugins can
   be written to add more.

>    Java's networking library provides bare-bones
    implementations of HTTP, Gopher and a few other protocols, so jEdit can
    also access remote files on non-FTP servers, albeit in a much more limited
    fashion.
    To open a URL, enter it in the
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Open Path</SPAN
> dialog box. Currently,
    saving to non-FTP URLs is not supported (this is a limitation of Java's
    networking library).

>    Because it is undesirable to block the GUI while loading or saving
    buffers (especially with FTP filesystem)
    jEdit executes all I/O operations asynchronously.
   </P
><P
>    When jEdit starts up, it creates a pool of "I/O work threads".
    The default number of threads is 4, which should be enough for the
    majority of cases; but this can be changed in the
    <SPAN
