><P
>   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on your operating system;
   on Unix systems, you might type "jedit" at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you might
   double click on the jEdit icon. By default,
   jEdit, when started will load any files that
   were open in the previous session. A specific file to edit can be specified
   on the command line, or by dropping a file onto the jEdit icon.
   jEdit displays a "splash screen" while starting up.

>    The first time jEdit is run, it will display an "initial setup
    wizard" which will help you configure firewall settings (so
    that jEdit features that make HTTP connections will work), install
    plugins using the plugin manager (see <A
HREF="plugins.html"
>Chapter 8</A
> for
    more information about plugins) and give you some pointers to
    further information. Similarly, after upgrading to a new jEdit version,
    an "update wizard" will help you update your plugins and
    give pointers to the change log so you can see what's new.
   </P
><P
>    Both of these wizards are self-explanatory and very easy to use,
    and therefore will not be covered in any more detail in this manual.

>   After jEdit has finished loading, the editor window will
   appear. Most user interface elements will be instantly familiar to users
   of graphical environments such as Windows, MacOS or GNOME. Some features
   are unique to jEdit, however. They will be described in the following
   paragraphs.
  </P
><P
>   The combo box above the text area is used to select the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>buffer</I
>
   to edit. Each open file is loaded into its own buffer.
   One of the following icons is displayed next to each buffer name in the
   list, depending on the state of the buffer:
  </P

><UL
><LI
><P
>   <IMG

   Displayed if the buffer is a new buffer that
     hasn't yet been saved to disk
  </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>   The column and line number
   containing the caret is displayed immediately to
   the right of the buffer selector.

>   For the pedantic programmers among us,
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>end of line markers</I
> at the end of each line are helpful for
   locating lines with trailing whitespace.
   The vertical blue line is a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>wrap guide</I
>; entering characters
   beyond this position will automatically insert a newline. See
   <A
HREF="entering-text.html"
>the section called <I
>Inserting and Deleting Text</I
> in Chapter 4</A
> for details.
  </P
><P
>   Clicking on the text area with
   the right mouse button will display a popup menu, offering quick
   access to various commands. Both the tool bar and context menu can be
   customized in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
>
   dialog box.
  </P
><P
>   Many aspects of the text area's operation can be customized to your liking
   in the <SPAN

>Text Area</SPAN
> pane of the
   <SPAN

>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
