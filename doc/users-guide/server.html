><P
>  When jEdit is
  launched, it first attempts to locate another running instance before
  starting up for real. If another copy happens to be running, it
  transfers control to it, passing any necessary file names.
  This technique saves time and memory when jEdit is started multiple times.
 </P
><P
>  Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
  TCP/IP sockets. When a server is started, it
  picks a random port number and authorization key (to prevent malicious
  remote users from opening files) and writes it to a
  <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>port file</I
> (usually in a well-known location). Client instances
  of jEdit then read the port file and connect to the specified port, passing
  it the authorization key and the file names to open, if any.
 </P

  The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-noserver</B
> command line switch disables the server features
  entirely;
  no connection will be attempted, and no sever will be started. The
  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-server</B
> command line switch specifies
  where port information is stored. This can be used to start more than
  one copy of jEdit.
  For example, you
  can start a new jEdit like so:

CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B

></TT
></PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>  Now any subsequent jEdit instances opened with the
  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-server=my-server-2</B
> parameter will connect to this instance.
 </P
><P
>  
  
  
  
  
  All jEdit command line parameters except those that affect initial
  startup (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-nosettings</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-settings</B
>
  and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-nosplash</B
>) are handled appropriately by the server.
  If the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-reuseview</B
> switch is specified, the client instance will
  open files in an existing view, rather than creating a new one.

>Background Mode</A
></H1
><P
>   If you find yourself launching and exiting jEdit often, you can save time
   by running it in <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>background mode</I
>. In background mode, jEdit
   will stay resident and wait for client requests, even when no views are
   open. To start jEdit in background mode, specify the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-background</B
>
   command line switch. jEdit will then start up normally, except that an
   initial view will only be created when a client connects.
  </P
><P
>   To completely exit jEdit when running in background mode, you must invoke
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Exit</SPAN
>; if you close all open views,
   jEdit will continue running, waiting for more requests.
