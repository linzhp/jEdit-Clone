>   When jEdit is
   launched, it first attempts to locate another running instance before
   starting up. If another copy happens to be running, it
   transfers control to it, passing any necessary file names.
   This technique saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times.
  </P
><P
>   Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
   TCP/IP sockets. When the initial instance is started, a random port
   number and authorization key is chosen, and written it to a
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>port file</I
> in a well-known location. An
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>edit server</I
> is then started which listens on the chosen port.
   Subsequent instances
   of jEdit then read the port file and connect to the specified port, passing
   it the authorization key and the file names to open, if any.

   The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-noserver</B
> command line switch disables the client/server
   features entirely;
   no connection will be attempted, and no sever will be started. The
   <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-server</B
> command line switch specifies
   where port information is stored. This can be used to start more than
   one copy of jEdit. For example, you
   can start a new jEdit like so:

>   Now any subsequent jEdit instances opened with the

   All jEdit command line parameters except those that affect initial
   startup (<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-nosettings</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-settings</B
>
   and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-nosplash</B
>) are handled appropriately by the server.
   If the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-reuseview</B
> switch is specified, the client instance will
   open files in an existing view, rather than creating a new one.

>Background Mode</A
></H2
><P
>    If you find yourself launching and exiting jEdit often, you can save time
    by running it in <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>background mode</I
>. In background mode, jEdit
    will stay resident and wait for client requests, even when no views are
    open. To start jEdit in background mode, specify the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-background</B
>
    command line switch. jEdit will then start up normally, except that an
    initial view will only be created after a client connects. To force an
    initial view to be created anyway, specify the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>-gui</B
> switch.
   </P
><P
>    To completely exit jEdit when running in background mode, you must invoke
    <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Exit</SPAN
>; if you close all open views,
    jEdit will continue running, waiting for more requests.
