><P
>   The <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>caret</I
> is the location where text insertion and
   deletion takes place. It is drawn as a blinking red line (but like
   most text area parameters, that can be customized). Moving the caret
   is one of the most commonly performed operations and there are a
   number of ways to do it. The most basic are covered here; more
   advanced caret operations are described in <A
HREF="advanced-features.html"
>Chapter 4</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   The most direct way to move the caret is to click the
   mouse where you want it to be positioned. It can also be moved using the
   keyboard;
   The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Left</B
>, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Right</B
>, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Up</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Down</B
> keys
   move the caret in the respective direction.
   The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>PageUp</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>PageDown</B
> keys move the caret up
   and down one viewscreen, respectively.
  </P
><P
>   When pressed once, the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Home</B
> key will go to the first
   non-whitespace character on the current line. Pressing it multiple
   times will move the caret to the beginning of the line and then to
   the first visible line. <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>End</B
> behaves in a
   similar manner, going to the last non-whitespace character, the end of
   the line, and then to the last visible line.
