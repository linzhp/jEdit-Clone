><P
>   The <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>caret</I
> is the location where text insertion and
   deletion takes place. It is drawn as a blinking red line (but like
   most text area parameters, that can be customized). Moving the caret
   is one of the most commonly performed operations and there are a
   number of ways to do it. The most basic are covered here; more
   advanced caret operations are described in <A
HREF="advanced-features.html"
>Chapter 4</A
>.
  </P
><P
>   The most direct way to move the caret is to click the
   mouse where you want it to be positioned. It can also be moved using the
   keyboard;
   The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Left</B
>, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Right</B
>, <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Up</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Down</B
> keys
   move the caret in the respective direction.
   The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>PageUp</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>PageDown</B
> keys move the caret up
   and down one viewscreen, respectively.
  </P
><P
>   Pressing <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Home</B
> once will move the caret to the start of the
   current line. Pressing it again moves the caret to the start of the
   first visible line, and pressing it a third time moves the caret to
   the beginning of the buffer. Pressing
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Home</B
> will move the caret
   to the beginning of the buffer regardless of how many times it is
   pressed. The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>End</B
> key behaves in a similar manner except that
   it moves the caret to the end of the current line, end of last visible
   line and end of the buffer, respectively.
