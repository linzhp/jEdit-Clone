>   Each jEdit edit mode is actually a file written in XML,
   the <I

   to load arbitrary data files without having to worry about implementing
   a parser, doing error checking, etc.

>   There are two locations where new
   edit modes can be installed; the user-specific
   mode directory, and the system-wide mode directory. On Windows 95/98,
   it doesn't make any difference where modes are installed. On
   multiuser systems such as Unix or Windows NT, however, each user
   has their own mode directory, while the system-wide mode
   directory is shared by all users on the system.
  </P

>   To find out the path names of the two mode directories (which
   vary from system to system),
   invoke <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Reload Edit Modes</SPAN
>
   and look for messages like the following in the activity log
   (<SPAN

>   jEdit doesn't always load all edit modes on startup; doing so takes
   a long time! Instead, it loads a "mode cache" that stores the
   most important details about each edit mode, and then only loads
   individual edit
   modes when they are actually required. A side effect of this is that
   newly installed modes are not immediately available for use; you must
   first rebuild the cache by invoking <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Reload
   Edit Modes</SPAN

>Reload

   because it allows you to see changes to a mode definition file take
   effect without having to restart jEdit.
