   <SPAN

   stand-alone file system browser. The difference between the dialog box
   and stand-alone version is that the latter does not go away after a file is
   selected.
   By default, the standalone browser is shown in its own window;
   it can also be set to dock into the view
   in the <SPAN

   <SPAN

  </P

>   In all instances, the file system browser consists of a tool bar, a path
   field, a filename filter field, and the file tree itself. The file tree
   allows an entire directory hierarchy to be viewed at once; try clicking
   on the expander control next to directories in the tree.

><SPAN

   is system-specific; on Windows, files with the "h" attribute
   are hidden. On Unix, files whose names begin with "." are
   hidden</P

>   The filename filter text field specifies a subset
   of the current directory to display in the form of a glob pattern.
   The default filter displays all files except for autosaves and backups.
   See <A
HREF="globs.html"
>Appendix F</A
> for more information about glob patterns.
   Both the path and filter fields support a history;
   see <A
HREF="history.html"
>Appendix B</A
> for details.
  </P
><P
>   Right-clicking on a file in the file system browser displays a popup menu,
   containing commands for manipulating that file, in addition to all the
   commands from the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>More</SPAN
> menu.
   If the file is already open, the popup will have commands to
   display it in the current view, display it in a new view, or close it.
   Unopened file popups have commands for opening, deleting and renaming.
   Note that attempting to delete a non-empty directory will give an error;
   only empty directories can be deleted.

   <P

CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Enter</B

    directory</P

    </P
></LI
><LI

    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Typing the first few characters of

    </P

   Note that the file tree must have keyboard focus for these keys to work.
