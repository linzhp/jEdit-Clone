   standalone version. By default, the standalone browser is shown in
   a separate frame, but if you prefer, you can set it to be docked into

   a filename filter field, and the file tree itself. The file tree allows
   an entire directory hierarchy to be viewed at once; try clicking
   on the expander control next to directories in the tree.

  </P

><UL
><LI
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Up</SPAN

><LI
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Local Drives</SPAN

   local drives in the file list. On Windows, this will be a list of
   drive letters; on Unix, the list will only contain one entry, the
   root directory (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/</TT

><LI
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Parent Directory of Current Buffer</SPAN

   take you to the directory containing the current buffer (if the current
   view is split into multiple panes, the "current buffer" is
   defined as the one that most recently had keyboard focus)</P

>Show Hidden Files</SPAN

   files will be shown in the file list. The definition of a hidden file
   is system-specific; on Windows, files with the "h" attribute
   are hidden. On Unix, files whose names begin with "." are
   hidden</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>New Directory</SPAN

   name and creates a directory with that name.
   Note that not all virtual filesystems may support this operation (the
   local and FTP filesystems do)
   </P

   selected) directory to the favorites list</P

>   The filter text field allows you to specify a subset
   of the current directory to display in the form of a glob pattern.
   See <A
HREF="globs.html"
>Appendix F</A

   Both the path and filter fields support a history;
   see <A

   details.

>   Right-clicking on a file in the VFS browser displays a popup menu, containing
   commands for manipulating that file, in addition to all the commands in the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>More</SPAN
> menu.
   If the buffer is already open, the popup will have commands to
   display it in the current view, display it in a new view, or close it.
   Unopened file popups have items for opening, deleting and renaming.
   Attempting to delete a non-empty directory will give an error; only
   empty directories can be deleted.
