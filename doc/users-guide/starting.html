><P
>   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system;
   on Unix systems, usually you would
   run the "jedit" command at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you might
   double click on the jEdit icon. jEdit automatically opens any files
   dropped onto its icon or specified on the command line. If no initial files
   were specified, jEdit comes up with the files that were open in the
   previous editing session.
  </P
><P
>   The first time jEdit is run, an "initial setup
   wizard" is shown. This wizard helps
   configure firewall settings (might be
   necessary in order for plugin download to work) and downloads and
   installs plugins (see <A
HREF="plugins.html"
>Chapter 6</A
> for
   more information about plugins). Similarly, after upgrading to a new
   jEdit version,
   an "update wizard" will optionally
   update installed plugins and
   give pointers to what's new in this jEdit release.
  </P
><P
>   Both of these wizards are self-explanatory and very easy to use,
   and therefore will not be covered in any more detail in this manual.
