>Current
   Buffer</SPAN
> menu, which displays a list of all open buffers. The tabs
   that run along the top of the text area serve a similar purpose.

   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>View</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Go to Last Edited Buffer</SPAN

   buffer that was being edited before you switched to the current one.

    the <SPAN

>Utilities</SPAN

   read only. Files can also be forced to open read only from the command line

   If there are unsaved changes in a buffer, "(modified)" will
   be displayed in the status bar

>Searching for Files</A
></H2
><P
>    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Open File</SPAN
> dialog box has a widget for quickly
    searching the filesystem for files with a specific
    name and/or modification time. The search is performed from the currently
    viewed directory.
   </P
><P
>    File names to search for can be specified in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Name</SPAN
> tab.
    The options in the combo box left of the text field allow you to specify
    how file names will be matched. Selecting "is" will only match
    files whose name is exactly that specified in the text field.
    "Contains", "starts with", "ends with" should be
    self-explanatory. "Pattern" will treat the contents of the
    text field as a glob pattern (see <A
HREF="globs.html"
>Appendix D</A
>) and match
    file names against that. If "Ignore Case" is selected, all
    file name matching will be case-insensitive.
   </P
><P
>    The <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Date</SPAN
> tab allows you to specify a start and end date,
    inclusive, that
    matched files's modification time must be in. The "big bang"
    and "big crunch" options allow you to specify an unbounded time
    range.
   </P
><P
>    Clicking <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Start</SPAN
> will begin the search. While a search is
    in progress, it can be interrupted by clicking <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Stop</SPAN
>.
    Found files will be listed in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Results</SPAN
> tab; clicking
    on one will select it in the file chooser.
