   caret was positioned within them. Recent files are listed in
   the <SPAN

>Recent Files</SPAN
> menu. When a recent file
   is opened, the caret
   is automatically moved to its location when the file was last edited.
   The number of recent files to remember can be changed and caret
   position saving can be disabled in the <SPAN

   <SPAN
