   jEdit remembers the last few edited files; they listed in the

   The <SPAN

>View</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>Current
   Buffer</SPAN
> menu, which displays a list of all open buffers. The tabs
   that run along the top of the text area serve a similar purpose.
   <SPAN

CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Go to Previous Buffer</SPAN

   buffer before the current one. <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"

>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Go to
   Next Buffer</SPAN

   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>View</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Go to Last Edited Buffer</SPAN
> selects the
   buffer that was being edited before you switched to the current one.

    if you have many buffers
    open. If this bothers you, they can be disabled in
    the <SPAN

>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"

   read only. Files can also be forced to open read only from the command line

   If there are unsaved changes in a buffer, "(modified)" will
   be displayed in the status bar
   and the <SPAN
