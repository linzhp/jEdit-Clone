   <SPAN

CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Open File</SPAN
> (keyboard
   equivalent: <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>O</B
>) pops
   up a dialog box allowing you to browse the file system and
   select a
   file to open. For a detailed treatment of this dialog box, see
   <A
HREF="vfs.html#VFS-BROWSER"
>the section called <I
>The VFS Browser</I
> in Chapter 8</A

   jEdit remembers the last few edited files; they listed in the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Recent Files</SPAN
> menu.
   The <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Current
   Directory</SPAN
> menu lists all files in the current buffer's directory.

>   Files that you do not have write access to are automatically opened
   read only. Files can also be forced to open read only from the command line
   by specifying the <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"

>-readonly</B
></TT
> option.

>   jEdit calls open files <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>buffers</I
>. The buffer tabs that run along
   the top of each text area can be used to switch between buffers.
   Another way to switch buffers is to use the various items in the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>View</SPAN
> menu; the <SPAN
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>Current Buffer</SPAN
> submenu, and the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Go to Previous Buffer</SPAN
>,
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Go to Next Buffer</SPAN
> and
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Go to Last Edited Buffer</SPAN
> commands.
   All of these are self-explanatory, except for the latter, which
   selects the buffer that was being edited before you switched
   to the current one.

    if you have many buffers
    open. If this bothers you, they can be disabled in
    the <SPAN

    <SPAN
