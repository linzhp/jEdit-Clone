>Autosave and Backups</A

>    jEdit's autosave feature protects your work from computer crashes and
    such. Every 30 seconds, all buffers with unsaved changes are
    written out to their respective file names, enclosed in hash
    ("#") characters. For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>program.c</TT
> will
    be autosaved to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>#program.c#</TT
>. Because saving a buffer using
    one of the commands in the previous section automatically deletes the
    autosave file, they will never be visible during normal operation.
    However, if jEdit crashes before you have a
    chance to save, the autosave file will remain, along with your unsaved
    changes, and jEdit will offer to recover the autosaved data next time the
    original file is opened.
   </P
><P
>    Another safety feature is file backups. When a buffer is saved
    for the first time after being opened, its original contents are
    preserved in buffer's file name suffixed with a tilde ("~").
    For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>paper.tex</TT
> will get backed up to
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>paper.tex~</TT
>.
    Backups can be used to roll back to the previous version
    of a file after changes were made.
   </P
><P
>    The autosave and backup features can be configured
    in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Loading and Saving</SPAN

>    The three major operating systems use different conventions to mark
    line endings in text files.
    The MacOS uses Carriage-Return characters (\r, ^M) for that purpose. Unix
    uses Newline characters (\n, ^J). DOS and Windows use both
    (\r\n, ^M^J). jEdit can read and write files in all three formats.
    The line separator of the current buffer can be changed
    in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"

>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Buffer Options</SPAN

    The default for new files can be changed in the <SPAN
