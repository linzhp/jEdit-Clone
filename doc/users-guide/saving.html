    jEdit's autosave feature protects
    against computer crashes and such.
    Every 30 seconds, all buffers with changes are
    written out to their respective file names, enclosed in hash
    ("#") characters. (For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>program.c</TT
> will
    be autosaved to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>#program.c#</TT
>). When you save a buffer, its
    autosave file is deleted. But if jEdit crashes before you can save,
    the autosave file will remain, and jEdit will offer to
    recover the autosaved data next time the file is opened.

    Another useful safety feature is file backups. When you save a buffer
    for the first time after opening it, its original contents are
    saved to the buffer's file name suffixed with a tilde ("~").
    For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>paper.tex</TT
> is backed up to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>paper.tex~</TT
>.
    The point of backups so that if you make extensive changes to a file, and then
    change your mind, you can go back to the previous version.

    The three major operating systems use different conventions to mark
    line endings in text files.
    The MacOS uses Carriage-Return (\r, ^M) for that purpose. Unix
    uses Newline (\n, ^J). DOS and Windows use Carriage-Return-Newline
    (\r\n, ^M^J). jEdit can read and write all three formats.
    The line separator of the current buffer can be changed
    in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Buffer Options</SPAN
> dialog box.
    The default for new files can be changed in the <SPAN

    has changed an open buffer on disk.
    You will be given the choice to
    continue editing (and lose changes made by the other application)
    or to reload the buffer. If you prefer, this feature can be disabled in the

    It is useful after performing a CVS checkin or similar; CVS inserts
    version info in all files it commits, hence they must be re-read from
    disk to be up-to-date.
