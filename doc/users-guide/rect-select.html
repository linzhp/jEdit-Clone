   As mentioned in <A
HREF="selection.html"
>the section called <I
>Selecting Text</I
> in Chapter 3</A
>, selections can span rectangular
   regions. Deleting, replacing, copying, pasting, and so on works
   as expected on rectangles. All jEdit builtin commands are rectangle-aware;
   however, some plugins might not be. Note that because rectangular
   selections are implemented using character offsets, rather than
   absolute screen positions, they might not behave as one might expect
   when proportional-width fonts or tabs are used. For best results
   use monospaced fonts and soft tabs when editing columnar files.

>   A rectangular selection can be created by dragging the mouse while
   holding down <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
>. Holding down
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Shift</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
> while clicking a location in
   the buffer will extend a rectangular selection.

   will toggle the current selection between continuous and rectangular mode.

>   It is possible to select a rectangle with zero width but non-zero height.
   This can be used to insert a new column between two existing
   columns. Such "zero-width" selections are shown as a thin
   vertical line.
