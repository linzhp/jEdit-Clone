>   Text entered at the
   keyboard is inserted into the buffer. When inserting text,
   keep in mind that the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Tab</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Enter</B
> keys might
   not behave entirely like you expect because various indentation
   features are enabled; see <A
HREF="indent.html"
>the section called <I
>Tabbing and Indentation</I
> in Chapter 5</A
> for details.
  </P
><P
>   Another way to insert text is to use overstrike mode.
   To activate overstrike mode, press
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Insert</B
>. In overstrike mode, the caret is drawn differently,
   and one character is deleted from in
   front of the caret position for every character that is inserted.
  </P
><P
>   Inserting text while there is a selection
   will replace the selection with the newly entered text.
  </P
><P
>   Inserting text at the end of a line beyond the wrap column will
   automatically place a newline
   at the appropriate word boundary. There are several ways to set the wrap
   column:
  </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The wrap column can be set on a global or mode-specific
   basis in the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Editing</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Mode-Specific</SPAN
> panes of the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
>
   dialog box.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The wrap column can be set in the current buffer
   for the duration of the editing session in the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Buffer Options</SPAN
> dialog box.
   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The wrap column can be set in the current buffer
   for future editing sessions with buffer-local properties by placing
   the following in one of the first 10 lines of the buffer, where
   <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>flag</I
></TT
> is either "true" or "false":

   above means.

   The simplest way to delete text is with the
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Delete</B
> keys. If nothing is
   selected, they delete the character before and after the caret,
   respectively. If a selection is active, both keys delete the
   selection.
