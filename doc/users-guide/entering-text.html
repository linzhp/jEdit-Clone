>   Unless overstrike mode is on (see below) any text typed at the
   keyboard is inserted into the buffer.. When you are inserting text,
   keep in mind that the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Tab</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Enter</B
> keys might
   not behave entirely like you expect because various indentation
   features are enabled; see <A
HREF="indent.html"
>the section called <I
>Tabbing and Indentation</I
> in Chapter 6</A
> for details.
  </P
><P
>   Another way to enter text is with the overstrike mode. Pressing
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Insert</B
> will change the caret into the overstrike caret.
   Now, entered text will not be <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>inserted</I
>, but it will
   <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>replace</I
> the existing text, character by character.
  </P
><P
>   Regardless if overstrike mode is on, entering text while a selection
   is active will replace the selection with the newly entered text.

   The simplest way to delete text is with the
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Delete</B
> keys. If nothing is
   selected, they delete the character before and after the caret,
   respectively. If a selection is active, both keys delete the
   selection.
