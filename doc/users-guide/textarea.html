><P
>   The text area is where text editing takes place. It behaves in a similar
   manner to many Windows and MacOS editors; the few
   unique features will be described in this section.
  </P
><P
>   The text area will automatically scroll up or down if the caret is moved
   closer than three lines to the first or last visible line. This
   feature is called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>electric scrolling</I
> and can be disabled
   in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Text Area</SPAN
> pane of the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
>
   dialog box.
  </P
><P
>   To aid in locating the caret, the current line is drawn with a slightly
   different background color.
   With most editors, if a line of text ends with whitespace, it is not
   immediately apparent where the whitespace ends. jEdit remidies this by
   displaying end of line markers at the end of each line. End of line markers
   can be disabled in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Text Area</SPAN
> pane of the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
>
   dialog box.
  </P
><P
>   The vertical blue line is a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>wrap guide</I
>; entering characters
   beyond this position inserts a line break at the appropriate position. See
   <A
HREF="entering-text.html"
>the section called <I
>Inserting and Deleting Text</I
> in Chapter 3</A
> for more information about word wrap.
  </P
><P
>   Clicking the text area with the right mouse button displays a popup menu.
   Both this menu and the tool bar at the top of the view offer quick
   mouse-based access to frequently-used commands.
   The contents of the tool bar and context menu can be
   changed in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN
>
   dialog box.
  </P
><P
>   The column and line number
   containing the caret, as well as the total number of lines in the buffer,
   is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the text area.
   In addition, the text area can optionally show line numbers next to
   displayed lines. To enable this, either
   double-click on the thin vertical strip to the left of the text area, or
   invoke
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>View</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Gutter Expanded</SPAN
> (shortcut:
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>E</B
>
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>T</B
>). In addition to line
   numbers, the gutter also indicates which lines have markers or position
   registers pointing to them. (See <A
HREF="markers.html"
>the section called <I
>Markers</I
> in Chapter 3</A
>
   and <A
HREF="registers.html#POS-REGISTERS"
>the section called <I
>Position Registers</I
> in Chapter 3</A
>)
  </P
><P
>   The gutter can be resized by dragging with the mouse. The
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>View</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Save Gutter Size</SPAN
> command makes
   the gutter's current size the default for future sessions.
