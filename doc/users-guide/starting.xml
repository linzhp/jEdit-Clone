 <sect1 id="conventions"><title>Conventions</title>
  <para>
   Several conventions are used throughout the manual. They will be
   described here.
  </para>
  <para>
   When a menu item selection is being described, the
   top level menu is listed first, followed by successive levels of submenus,
   finally followed by the menu item itself. All menu components are separated
   by greater-than symbols (<quote>&gt;</quote>). For example,
   <guimenu>View</guimenu>&gt;<guisubmenu>Scrolling</guisubmenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Scroll
   to Current Line</guimenuitem> refers to the <guimenuitem>Scroll to Current
   Line</guimenuitem> command contained in the
   <guisubmenu>Scrolling</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.
  </para>
  <para>
   As with many other applications, menu items that end with
   ellipsis (...) display dialog boxes or windows when invoked.
  </para>
  <para>
   Many jEdit commands can be also be invoked using keystrokes. This speeds
   up editing by letting you keep your hands on the keyboard. Not all
   commands with keyboard shortcuts
   are accessible with one key stroke; for example, the
   keyboard shortcut for <guimenuitem>Scroll to Current Line</guimenuitem> is
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>J</keycap></keycombo>. That is, you
   must first
   press <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>, followed by
   <keycombo><keycap>Control</keycap><keycap>J</keycap></keycombo>.
  </para>
  <sidebar><title>MacOS</title>
   <para>
    When running on MacOS, the primary modifier key is <keycap>Command</keycap>,
    not <keycap>Control</keycap>. If you are a Mac user, mentally substitute
    <keycap>Command</keycap> whenever you see <keycap>Control</keycap> in this
    guide.
   </para>
  </sidebar>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="starting-any-os"><title>Platform-Independent Instructions</title>
  <para>
   Exactly how jEdit is started depends on the operating system;
   on Unix systems, usually you would
   run the <quote>jedit</quote> command at the command line,
   or select jEdit from a menu; on Windows, you might
   double click on the jEdit launcher icon. Specific instructions for
   using the Windows launcher can be found in
   <xref linkend="starting-windows" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   If jEdit is started while another copy is already running, control is
   transferred to the running copy, and a second instance is not loaded.
   This saves time and memory if jEdit is started multiple times.
   Communication between instances of jEdit is implemented using
   TCP/IP sockets; the initial instance is known as the
   <firstterm>server</firstterm>, and subsequent invocations are
   <firstterm>clients</firstterm>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the <command>-background</command> command line switch is specified,
   jEdit will continue running and waiting for client requests even
   after all editor windows are closed. The advantage of background mode
   is that you can open and close jEdit any number of times, only having
   to wait for it to start the first time. The downside of background
   mode is that jEdit will continue to consume memory when no windows
   are open.
  </para>
  <para>
   For more information about command line switches that control the
   server feature, see <xref linkend="cli-usage" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   Unlike other applications, jEdit automatically loads any files that were
   open last time in was used, so you can get back to work immediately, without
   having to find the files you are working on first. This feature can be
   disabled in the <guibutton>Loading and Saving</guibutton> pane of the
   <guimenu>Utilities</guimenu>&gt;<guimenuitem>Global Options</guimenuitem>
   dialog box; see <xref linkend="global-opts" />.
  </para>
  <sidebar><title>The edit server and security</title>
   <para>
    Not only does the server pick a random TCP port number on startup,
    it also requires that clients provide an <firstterm>authorization
    key</firstterm>; a randomly-generated number only accessable to
    processes running on the local machine.
    So not only will <quote>bad guys</quote> have to guess a 64-bit integer,
    they will need to get it right on the first try; the edit server
    shuts itself off upon receiving an invalid packet.
   </para>
   <para>
    In environments that demand absolute security, the edit server can be
    disabled by specifying the <command>-noserver</command> command line switch.
   </para>

 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="cli-usage"><title>Command Line Usage</title>
  <para>
   On operating systems that support a command line, jEdit can be passed
   various arguments to control its behavior.
  </para>
  <para>
   When opening files from the command line, a line number or marker to
   position the caret on can be specified like so:
  </para>
  <screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit MyApplet.java +line:10</userinput><!--
  --><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>jedit thesis.tex +marker:chapter5</userinput></screen>
  <para>
   A number of options can also be specified to control several obscure features.
   They are listed in the following table.

      be created if it does not exist. Has no effect

     <row>
      <entry>-usage</entry>
