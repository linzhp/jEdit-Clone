  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
    This is an installation and use guide for jEditLauncher - a set of
    lightweight components for using the jEdit text editor in the Windows
    group of operating systems. The jEditLauncher package is designed to run
    on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT (versions 3.51 and
    greater) and Windows 2000. This version is designed to work with
    jEdit version 3.2pre4 and later.  It will not work with earlier
    versions.
  </para>

<simplesect>
  <title>How it works</title>
  <para>
    While jEdit does not make available a component-type interface, it does
    contains an <quote>EditServer</quote> that listens on a socket for
    requests to load files for editing. When the server activates, it writes
    the server port number and a pseudo-random, numeric authorization key to
    a text file. By default, the file is named <filename>server</filename>
    and is located in the same directory as other jEdit files containing
    user settings. The jEditLauncher component locates and reads this file,
    opens a socket and attempts to connect to the indicated port. If
    successful, it transmits one or more file names to the server. If
    unsuccessful, it attempts to start jEdit and repeats the socket
    transmission.
  </para>

  <title>Files in the jEditLauncher package</title>
  <para>
    The jEditLauncher package consists of the following files:

<simplesect>
  <title>The COM component</title>
  <para>
    The core of the jEditLauncher package is a COM component that can
    communicate with the EditServer, or open jEdit if it is not running or
    is otherwise refusing a connection. The component supports both Windows
    and UNC file specifications, including wild cards. It will resolve
    shortcut links to identify and transmit the name of the underlying file.
  </para>

  <para>
    Because it is implemented with a <quote>dual interface</quote>, the
    functions of jEditLauncher are available to scripting languages in the
    Windows environment such as VBScript, JScript, Perl (using the
    Win32::OLE package) and Python (using the win32com.client package).
    A low-level interface is also available for use by C or C++ client
    code or facilities like Python's MakePy utility.
  </para>

</simplesect>

<simplesect>
  <title>The jEditLauncher interface</title>
  <para>
    The jEditLauncher interface is set forth in the definition of the
    abstract C++ class <classname>IJEditLauncher</classname>. It is a
    <quote>interface</quote> or pure abstract class derived from the
    <classname>IDispatch</classname> interface used for components that can
    be addressed using Microsoft's <quote>Automation</quote> technology. The
    <quote>IJEditLauncher</quote> interface has two parts: a scriptable
    interface tied to <classname>IDispatch</classname>, and a <quote>direct
    client</quote> interface with methods that use primitive data types.
  </para>

  <para>
    The scriptable interface consists of two read-only properties and
    three functions:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>ServerPort</emphasis> - a read-only property that returns the
        port number found in jEdit's server file; the value is not tested for
        authenticity. It returns zero if the server information file cannot
        be located.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>ServerKey</emphasis> - a read-only property that returns the numeric
        authorization key found in jEdit's server file; the value is not tested
        for authenticity. It returns zero if the server information file cannot
        be located.
        </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>OpenFile</emphasis> - a method that takes a single file name
        (with or without wild card characters) as a parameter.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>OpenFiles</emphasis> - this method takes a array of file names
        (with or without wild card characters) as a parameter. The form of the
        array is that which is used for arrays in the scripting environment. In
        JScript, for example the data type of the <type>VARIANT</type> holding
        the array is <type>VT_DISPATCH</type>; in VBScript, it is <type>VT_ARRAY
        | VT_VARIANT</type>, with array members having data type
        <type>VT_BSTR</type>.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Launch</emphasis> - this method with no parameters attempts to
        open jEdit without loading additional files.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
    The <quote>direct client</quote> interface provides substitutes for the
    <function>OpenFile</function> and <function>OpenFiles</function>
    functions that are suitable for use in client code (such as the
    <application>jEdit.exe</application> utility) with either 16-bit or
    <quote>wide</quote> 32-bit character data:

      </funcprototype>
    </funcsynopsis>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

	<para>
    In the latter two functions, the parameters are a pointer to an
    array of character strings and the number of elements in the array.
    Each of the four low-level functions returns zero if successful and a
    COM-specific error code if it fails.  Error information is available
    for scripts or other client code to trap and report using
    conventional techniques.  Examples of error reporting may be found in
    the source code for <application>jedit.exe</application>.
  </para>

</simplesect>

<simplesect>
  <title>Scripting examples</title>
  <para>
    Here are brief examples of scripts using jEditLauncher. The first
    two will run under Windows Script Host, which is either installed or
    available for download for 32-bit Windows operating systems. The last
    example is written in Perl and requires the Win32::OLE package.
  </para>
  <para>
    If Windows Script Host is installed, you can run the first two
    scripts by typing the name of the file containing the script at a
    command prompt.  In jEdit's Console plugin, you can type
    <userinput>cmd /c <replaceable>script_path</replaceable></userinput> or
    <userinput>wscript <replaceable>script_path</replaceable></userinput>.

  <title> The context menu handler</title>
  <para>
    The COM component also implements a context menu handler for the Windows
    shell. It is intended to be be installed as a handler available for any
    file. When you right-click on a file or shortcut icon, the context
    menu that appears will include an item displaying the jEdit icon and
    captioned <guilabel>Open with jEdit</guilabel>. If the file has an extension,
    another item will appear captioned <guilabel>Open *.XXX with jEdit</guilabel>,
    where XXX is the extension of the selected file. Clicking this item will
    cause jEdit to load all files with the same extension in the same directory
    as the selected file. Multiple file selections are also supported; in this
    circumstance only the <guilabel>Open with jEdit</guilabel> item appears.
  </para>
</simplesect>

<simplesect>
  <title>jedit.exe - a utility for launching jEdit</title>
    <para>
      Another component of the jEditLauncher package is a client application
      entitled <application>jedit.exe</application>. It may be executed either
      from the command line or the graphical shell. It uses the jEditLauncher
      COM component to open files in jEdit that are listed as command line
      parameters. Like the component, it supports Windows and UNC file
      specifications as well as wild cards. If called without parameters, it
      will launch jEdit. If jEdit is already running and has an active
      EditServer, it will simply open a new, empty buffer.
    </para>

    <para>
      From the command line, jedit.exe has four command-line options. If any
      option is invoked correctly, the application will not load files or execute jEdit.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The option <userinput>/h</userinput> causes a window to be displayed
          with a brief description of the application and its various options.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          The option <userinput>/p</userinput> will activate a dialog window
          displaying the command-line parameters to be used when calling jEdit.
        </para>
        <para>
          Using the dialog, you can change parameters specifying the executable for
          the Java interpreter, the jar archive file or class name used as the
          target of the interpreter, and command line options for both. If the
          <userinput>-jar</userinput> option is not used for the Java executable,
          the principal jEdit class of
          <classname>org.gjt.sp.jedit.jEdit</classname> is set as fixed data. The
          working directory for the Java interpreter's process can also be
          specified. A read-only window at the bottom of the dialog displays
          the full command-line that jEditLauncher will invoke.
        </para>

        <para>
          Before committing changes to the command line parameters,
          <application>jedit.exe</application> validates the paths for the Java
          and jEdit targets as well as the working directory. It will complain if
          the paths are invalid. It will not validate command-line options, but it
          will warn you if it finds the <userinput>-noserver</userinput> option
          used for jEdit, since this will deactivate the EditServer and make it
          impossible for jEditLauncher to open files.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          The option <userinput>/i</userinput> is not mentioned in the help window
          for <filename>jedit.exe</filename>. It is intended primarily to be used
          in conjunction with jEdit's Java installer, but it can also be used to
          install or reinstall jEditLauncher manually. When accompanied by a second
          parameter specifying the directory where your preferred Java interpreter
          is located, jEditLauncher will install itself and set a reasonable
          initial set of command line parameters for executing jEdit. You can
          change these parameters later by running <filename>jedit.exe</filename>
          with the<userinput>/p</userinput> option.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          The option <userinput>/u</userinput> will cause jEditLauncher
          to be uninstalled by removing its registration entries.  Pending
          full integrations with jEdit, this option currently does not
          delete any jEditLauncher or jEdit files.
          <!--
          Since the Java installer that does the bulk of
          jEdit's installation does not keep a record of files to be deleted, the
          uninstall routine takes the approach of deleting all files in the
          installation directory after obtaining confirmation of a request to
          uninstall. If you wish to save files in the the installation directory
          or any of its subdirectories, you should move them to another location
          before uninstalling jEdit. -->

  <title>jedinit - a utility for setting jEdit parameters</title>
  <para>
    The jEditLauncher package includes
    <application>jedinit.exe</application> as a shortcut to the dialog
    interface used by <application>jedit.exe</application> to set command
    line parameters.  This allows you to set parameters directly from
    the Windows shell without having to enter <userinput>jedit /p</userinput>
    from a command line.  Its only operating requirement is that it is
    located in the same directory as
    <application>jedit.exe</application>.

      To install jEditLauncher following a successful install of jEdit,

      Anytime <filename>jedit.exe</filename> is executed (either directly or

      jEditLauncher checks to see if it is properly installed. If it is not,
      it will offer to install itself. If you agree, you will then be asked to
      supply the path to a Java interpreter. The directory you choose should
      contain <filename>java.exe</filename>, which the installer uses as a
      default; you can change the interpreter later with a call to
      <filename>jedinit.exe</filename>.
    </para>
</simplesect>

<simplesect>
  <title>Working with multiple jEdit installations</title>
  <para>
    At the present time, jEditLauncher is supported only for versions of
    jEdit beginning with version 3.2pre4. Future versions will target
    specific versions of jEdit so that users can select between a
    <quote>final</quote> version or a later development version as the
    target version for purposes of scripting and the context menu handler.
    Each version of jEditLauncher should be installed in the same directory
    as the version of jEdit to which it relates.

    <!--
    The jEdit project has a rapid turnaround time on new versions, and there
    is an active community of jEdit users who are willing to try out new
    features in development versions. As a result, many users have more than
    one version of the application installed at the same time. The
    jEditLauncher package accomodates this unusual circumstance. Both
    <filename>jedit.exe</filename> and <filename>jedinint.exe</filename> are
    designed to target a specific version of jEdit.

    A set of jEditLauncher
    files will work only with one version of jEdit. For the sake of good
    order, you should keep the jEditLauncher files that accompany a
    particular version of jEdit in the same directory as the executable
    archive file, <filename>jedit.jar</filename>, for that version. -->
  </para>

  <!--
  <para>
    There is one feature of jEditLauncher - the context menu handler - that
    attaches itself to the Windows shell such that only one jEdit version
    can be targeted. In addition, the use of jEditLauncher as a scripting
    object would generally target a single version. If the installation
    program detects more than one installed version of jEdit (including the
    version being installed), it requires you to select a
    <quote>primary</quote> version of jEdit that will be invoked by the
    context menu handler and by scripting objects. Likewise, if there is
    more than one installed version of jEdit remaining after a version in
    uninstalled, the uninstall routine will offer a choice between the
    remaining versions. Whenever there is only one installed version,
    jEditLauncher adopts that version as the primary version without user
    intervention.
  </para>

  <para>
    The easiest way to change the primary version of jEdit among existing
    installed versions is to reinstall any version in the directory where it
    is currently situated, and then select the new primary version when
    prompted by the installation routine.
  </para>

  <para>
    If an installation changes the primary version of jEdit, it may be
    necessary to reboot to complete an installation. This is because the
    context menu handler remains in memory for some time after it is used
    on some version of Windows, so that the file containing the COM component
    cannot be overwritten by a new version.  Like other Windows programs,
    jEditLauncher will complete the installation automatically upon reboot.
    It is best to reboot right away after installation if you are requested
    to do so.
  </para>

  <para>
    If you install a version of jEdit that is already installed to a
    different directory, the installation routine will update installation
    data and effectively ignore the original installation. You can then delete
    the <quote>old</quote> copy manually.  It may be necessary to
    log out and log in again, or even reboot, to delete the old version of
    the COM component.
  </para>
  -->
</simplesect>

<simplesect>
  <title>Shortcuts</title>
  <para>
    The jEditLauncher installation routine creates shortcuts for the
    <quote>primary</quote> version of jEdit on the Windows desktop, in the
    Start menu and in the Programs menu. Any of these may be deleted
    manually without compromising the performance of jEdit or jEditLauncher.
  </para>

  <title>Uninstalling <!-- jEdit and  -->jEditLauncher</title>
  <para>
    There are three ways to uninstall <!-- jEdit and  -->jEditLauncher.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        First, you can invoke <filename>jedit.exe</filename> with the
        <userinput>/u</userinput> option from the command line. <!-- This will
        uninstall the version of jEdit residing in the same directory as the
        version of <filename>jedit.exe</filename> that you invoke. -->
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Second, you can choose <guilabel>Uninstall jEdit</guilabel> in the
        <guilabel>jEdit</guilabel> section of the Programs menu. <!-- This will
        uninstall the <quote>primary</quote> version of jEdit (and will
        designate a new primary version if any versions remain). -->
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Third, you can choose the uninstall option for jEdit in the Control
        Panel's Add/Remove Programs applet.
        <!-- This allows you to specify
        unambiguously the version of jEdit that you wish to remove. -->
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
    At the present time each of this options functions unregisters
    jEditLauncher but does not delete any files belonging to jEditLauncher
    or jEdit. As a safeguard, jEditLauncher displays a warning window and
    requires the user to confirm an uninstall operation.
  </para>
<!--
  <para>
    The uninstall routine does not selectively delete installed files
    but instead tries to delete all files in the directory in which jEdit
    is installed.  As a safeguard, jEditLauncher displays a warning window
    and requires the user to confirm an uninstall operation.  If you
    have files in the jEdit directory tree that you wish to save
    following an uninstall, you should move them before you start the
    uninstall operation.
  </para>

  <para>
    Following an uninstall operation, it will usually be necessary to
    reboot to complete the procedure.  If a reboot is necessary you will
    be asked to confirm a reboot at the end of the uninstall procedure.
  </para>

  <para>
    The uninstall operation does not affect files or directories
    containing individual user settings for jEdit. Normally these can be
    deleted manually.

    package itself. As one might expect, the source code for the package
    relies heavily on template classes and headers for COM objects that are
    supplied with Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0 product. Because of licensing
    restrictions, those files are not part of the source code distribution.
    The executables were compiled using the Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 IDE.
    Makefiles generated by the IDE are included, They are written for
    Microsoft's <application>NMAKE</application> utility and are not
    compatible with mainstream make syntax.
  </para>

  <para>
    The source code distribution should be sufficient to allow for
    compilation of jEditLauncher's four executables file in the Visual
    Studio IDE. Besides the source for the four executable files, the
    distribution includes code for a utility for testing the installation
    module.
  </para>

  <para>
      If you are interested in building jEditLauncher from its source code,
      you should first examine the IDE settings for <quote>Custom
      Build</quote> to enable or disable (as you choose) automatic
      registration of the COM component following compilation. The project
      files will not register the COM component as a context menu handler.
      You should also modify the directory settings to conform to your own
      file layout.
  </para>

  <para>
    The executables included with this distribution are the
    <quote>ReleaseMinDependency</quote> build of the COM component and the
    <quote>Release</quote> build of the other executables.
