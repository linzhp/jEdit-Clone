JEDIT VERSION HISTORY

* Version 2.4pre1

+ Enhancements

- In the multifile search settings dialog box, the default values of the
  'directory' and 'glob' fields are taken from the current buffer's
  directory and filename extension, respectively
- If the only opened file is an untitled file with no changes, opening
  another file will close the untitled file

+ Bug Fixes

- When using JEditTextAreas standalone, not having a status component would
  throw NPEs (since 2.3pre2)

- When doing a 'save as', buffers weren't repositioned in the buffer
  list if sorting is enabled (since 2.3pre2)
