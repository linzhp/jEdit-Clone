JEDIT VERSION HISTORY

* Version 2.4pre1

+ New Features

- The syntax highlighting system no longer reparses lines every time
  they are drawn; instead, tokens are cached and lines are only parsed
  when the document changes. This should result in smoother scrolling
  and improved performance in general
- Subsequent tokens with the same id are now merged by the syntax
  highlighting system, this should improve performance when using XMode
- JEditTextArea internals have been cleaned up and simplified somewhat
- Views now check if their buffers have changed on disk every time they
  gain focus (this can be disabled in Utilities->Global Options if
  desired)
- You can now have more than one split in a view
- C+F11 and C+F12 go to the previous and next split pane, respectively
- C+e TAB toggles between the current and previous edited buffers
- The current repeat count, if any, is now shown in the status bar
- 'Complete Word' now displays a dialog box listing all completions if
  there is more than one
- Opening a file which is already open will ask if it should be reloaded

+ Enhancements

- In the multifile search settings dialog box, the default values of the
  'directory' and 'glob' fields are taken from the current buffer's
  directory and filename extension, respectively
- If the only opened file is an untitled file with no changes, opening
  another file will close the untitled file
- 'Save As' warns you before overwriting an existing file
- Plugin manager now prints exception tracebacks to the activity log

+ Bug Fixes

- When using JEditTextAreas standalone, not having a status component would
  throw NPEs (since 2.3pre2)
- Removed debugging message when doing a 'save as' (since 2.3pre2)
- When doing a 'save as', buffers weren't repositioned in the buffer
  list if sorting is enabled (since 2.3pre2)

+ API Changes

- Signature of TokenMarker.markTokensImpl() and TokenMarker.addToken() methods
  changed; this breaks XMode
