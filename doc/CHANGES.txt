JEDIT 3.1 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 3.1pre1

+ New Features

- File permissions are now preserved when saving files on Unix systems

+ Enhancements

- Edit menu rearranged and simplified a little
- Instead of loading all edit modes the first time it is started, and a
  cache on subsequent starts, jEdit now loads a 'mode catalog' file,
  which must be manually updated when modes are added or removed. There
  is one catalog in the system mode directory, and one in the user mode
  directory. This eliminates the lengthy wait when starti2ng jEdit for
  the first time.
- Plugin shortcuts are now shown in a separate option pane
- Gutter changes:
  - Gutter can no longer be resized
  - 'Gutter Expanded' and 'Line Numbering' commands merged into one
  - Marker/register highlighting can now be toggled
  - Gutter is repainted more efficently
- Multiple subsequent insertions are now batched into one undo - no more
  undoing character-by-character!
- Docking area separators now look like split pane dividers when running
  with the Metal look and feel
- jEdit now notices if a file's read only status changes on disk

+ API Changes

- EditAction.EditAction(String) deprecated. Plugins should no longer be
  subclassing EditAction; write an actions.xml file instead.
- MenuBarModel, MenuModel, MenuItemModel, ToolBarModel classes removed.
  Since plugins do not use these classes directly, it should not cause
  any breakage.
- invalidateLine(), invalidateLineRange() methods in Gutter and
  TextAreaPainter classes replaced by methods with same names in
  JEditTextArea class

+ Bug Fixes

- .shortcut properties in plugins that specified shortcuts for built-in
  actions didn't work
- Fixed an obscure roundoff error in the gutter code that could cause
  line numbers to not be repainted fully
- Mixed paths (eg, C:\files\project1/file) didn't work correctly on Windows
