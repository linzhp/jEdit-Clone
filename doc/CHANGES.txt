JEDIT 3.0 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 3.0pre1

+ New Features

- Macros can now be added to the tool bar and right-click context menu
- The bracket matching code now only checks syntax tokens of the same type
  as the bracket for matches. As a result, string literals and comments
  containing brackets should no longer cause problems
- New 'EditBuddy' plugin, included in the jEdit distribution, displays
  'initial setup' and 'new version' wizards when jEdit is first run and
  when a new version is installed, respectively. These wizards help you
  configure firewall settings, install and update plugins, view the
  change log, and other such stuff.
- 'Print' command now supports printing of line numbers, and many printing
  settings can now be customized in Utilities->Global Options->Printing
- I/O requests no longer block the GUI, and multiple requests can be
  executed at once. By default, 4 I/O threads are started; this can be
  changed in Utilities->Global Options
- I/O requests can be monitored and aborted in Utilities->I/O Progress
  Monitor. A miniature version of the progress display is in the status
  bar of each view

+ Enhancements

- Gutter border color now reflects if the respective text area has focus
- Menu bar code restructured somewhat
- View-related commands moved out of Utilities menu to new View top-level
  menu, Buffers menu is now a submenu of the new View menu as well
- Colored 'orbs' displaying file modification status are now displayed in
  the Buffers menu
- Registers and markers are now highlighted using different colors in the
  gutter
- The plugin manager now deletes files for real when removing and upgrading
  plugins; previously, it shoved them in a 'backup' directory
- Shortcut of 'Exit' command changed to C+q
- 'Exit' command now asks for confirmation (can be disabled in
  Utilities->Global Options)
- The directory search feature now sorts file names before searching
- Abbreviations and history files are not saved if they are changed on disk
  while jEdit is running
- The 'Help' menu now displays documentation for plugins that didn't load
- Improved Python mode (Ivan Frohne)
- Improved JSP mode (Vicente Salvador)
- Improved autosave feature -- dedicated autosave thread gone, and up to
  four files are autosaved at once
- The 'Plugins' and 'Help' menus now display 'More' submenus if there are
  a lot of items. This prevents them from being too long
- FTP browser is now threaded

+ Bug Fixes

- Fixed installer layout bug which might be the cause of exceptions people
  have been seeing on certain platforms
- Fixed minor cosmetic problem in status bar when entering repeat counts
  where the first digit is '1'
- When buffers were saved while the view was split, the focus would
  always shift to the last (bottom or rightmost) split pane
- JEditTextArea didn't unregister the gutter from the tooltip manager, this
  could result in memory leaks
- C, C++, Java and JavaScript didn't indent 'default:' statements properly

+ API Changes

- GUIUtilities.loadMenuItem(View,String) deprecated. Plugins targeted at
  jEdit 3.0 or later should use GUIUTilities.loadMenuItem(String) instead.
  Don't worry, since all existing plugins use the old method, it won't be
  removed any time soon, if at all.
- Return type of TokenMarker.markTokens() changed from Token to
  TokenMarker.LineInfo
- EditActions can now be invoked without a view (of course the action
  will still fail if it calls EditAction.getView())
- Signature of VFSManager.error() is now void error(Component comp,
  String msg, Object[] args)
