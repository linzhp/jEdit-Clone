JEDIT 3.0 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 3.0pre1

+ New Features

- Macros can now be added to the tool bar and right-click context menu

+ Enhancements

- Gutter border color now reflects if the respective text area has focus
- Menu bar code restructured somewhat

+ Incompatibilities

- Macro shortcuts are now stored in properties named "play-macro@<macro
  name>.shortcut". As a result, old macro key bindings will no longer
  work; you will need to reassign them. Yes, this change is annoying,
  but supporting the old scheme with the new menu bar code would be more
  effort than it's worth.

+ API Changes

- GUIUtilities.loadMenuItem(View,String) deprecated. Plugins targeted at
  jEdit 3.0 or later should use GUIUTilities.loadMenuItem(String) instead.
  Don't worry, since all existing plugins use the old method, it won't be
  removed any time soon, if at all.
