JEDIT 3.2 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 3.2pre1

+ New Features

- Caret registers and markers merged:
  - 'Markers' top level menu contains commands for manipulating markers.
  - Markers can no longer be named -- the menu just shows the line of
    text containing the marker, along with the line number.
  - Markers can have single-character 'shortcuts'. To add a marker with
    a shortcut, use the 'Add Marker With Shortcut' command.
  - Key strokes for dealing with markers with shortcuts are the same as
    the old register command keystrokes (C+t, C+y, C+u, C+k)
  - Unlike caret registers, which were global to the editor, markers are
    buffer-specific.
  - Registers are now only used to store text.
- X-Windows style copy and paste now supported: most recently selected
  text is stored in the '%' register, middle mouse button click (or
  Alt-click if you only have a 2 button mouse) inserts contents of that
  register.
- New 'Copy Append' (C+e C+a), 'Cut Append' (C+e C+u) commands append
  selected text to clipboard.
- New 'Cut Append to Register' (C+r C+u) command append selected text to
  specified register and removes it from the buffer.

+ Enhancements

- 'Auto wrap around' option in search and replace dialog box
- Edit server now binds to local host only (so that remote attackers
  can't compromise jEdit) and accepts no more than 2 simultaneous
  connection attempts (Mike Dillon)
- The 'Run Other Macro' command no longer uses the obsolete Swing file
  chooser dialog box
- Marker saving can now be toggled in Utilities->Global Options->Loading
  and Saving

+ Neutral

- 'Append to Register' command renamed 'Copy Append to Register'
- 'Replace All' no longer bound to C+e C+a

+ Bug Fixes

- print() should now work in BeanShell:
  - if invoked from Console plugin, prints output to console
  - otherwise, prints the specified string to the activity log, with log
    level 'warning' (so that it is also printed to the standard error
    stream)
- If a view was split and several buffers were visible, only one of them
  would be checked when the view gains focus for modification by another
  program
- The setting of the reverse search flag wasn't fully saved and restored
- The setting of the HyperSearch flag wasn't handled properly by the
  search bar
- Notepad macro threw an exception when its window was closed
- The 'Search in Current Buffer' and 'Search in Directory' macros didn't
  work

+ API Changes

- As jEdit now handles middle mouse button clicks itself, the XClipboard
  plugin will have to be modified to set a custom implementation of the
  '%' register, instead of trapping middle mouse clicks directly.
- Plugins are now loaded after the buffer history and macros are
  initialised
