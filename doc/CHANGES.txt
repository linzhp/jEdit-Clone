JEDIT 2.7 VERSION HISTORY

* Version 2.7pre1

+ New Features

- Word wrap:
  - The maximum line length is set by the 'maxLineLen' buffer property.
    The global default is 80; it can also be changed on a mode- and
    buffer-specific basis.
  - Setting it to zero disables word wrap.
  - If, when typing, the line length exceeds the maximum, a line break
    is inserted in the appropriate location.
  - A 'wrap guide' is drawn in the text area at the wrap column. This
    is similar to the LineGuides plugin.
- Ollie Rutherfurd's scrolling actions in View->Scrolling menu:
  - Scroll Up/Down Line: C+' and C+/
  - Scroll Up/Down Page: A+' and A+/
  - Center Caret: C+e C+i
- Checkbox to the right of the 'Filter:' field in the VFS browser can be
  used to temporarily display all files in the current directory
- 'File name' text field is now displayed in the 'Open File' dialog box
  as well as the 'Save As' dialog box
- A buffer list combo box replaces the buffer tabs component and
  View->Current Buffer menu
- 'File->Save a Copy As' command: same as 'Save As', except that the
  buffer's name isn't changed to the new name
- Commands in View->Docking Areas menu collapse/expand the window
  docking areas (bound to F6, F7, F8, F9 for top, left, right and bottom
  collapse/expand, respectively)
- jEdit now differentiates between the 'indent width' and 'tab width'.
  - the 'tab width' is only used when displaying tabs (\t), so should
    probably be set to 8 in most circumstances
  - the 'indent width' is used when shifting the indent, either using
    the 'shift-left' or 'shift-right' commands, or auto indent feature
- 'Synchronized Scrolling', which can be enabled in View->Scrolling,
  forces all text areas in a view to have the same scroll bar positions
- 'Insert File' command in File menu
- 'Replace and Find Next' command added (replaces 'Replace and Find Next'
  macro)
- If the <jedit install dir>/site-props directory exists, all property
  files are loaded from it on jEdit startup before user-specific properties.
  This can be used to enforce site-wide key bindings, color schemes, etc
  on multi-user systems (Mike Dillon)
- Format and Remove Trailing Whitespace actions from TextTools plugin
  integrated into the core
  - Format: bound to C+e f, reflows current paragraph or selection
  - Remove Trailing Whitespace: bound to C+e r, removes whitespace at
    the end of lines
- Multiple line search and replace now supported
- C# syntax highlighting (Ollie Rutherfurd)

+ Enhancements

- New default color scheme is easier on the eyes
- Better icons to indicate buffer new, dirty, read-only status
- If a selection is active, the left and right arrow keys now move to
  caret to the beginning and end of the selection, respectively
- Block cursor feature improved
- Search & replace and HyperSearch dialog boxes are 'pooled' and reused;
  as a result, after one of these dialogs has been opened once,
  subsequent displays should be faster
- More extensive Alt-key mnemonics in searching dialog boxes
- File system browsers are now reloaded if necessary after a 'save as'
- Caret location info moved to top right of text area
- The horizontal scroll bar, instead of having a fixed maximum value,
  is how adjusted according to the width of the longest visible line
- The 'append-to-register' command adds a newline to the text already in
  the register before appending
- Slightly faster HyperSearch over a directory of files
- HyperSearch now displays results in a tree format
- Minor change to dockable window behavior. If a dockable is open but
  it's container is collapsed, invoking the dockable's action will
  expand the container
- Deleting a file that is currently open in jEdit is now handled better
- When scrolling long distanes, the caret is now centered on the screen
- Buffer properties are reset when the edit mode is changed. For example,
  if your default tab size is set to 8 but Java tab size set to 4 and
  you save a new file with the ".java" extension, the tab size will
  automatically change to 4
- New options dialog layout

+ Neutral

- Key binding changes:
  - 'Gutter Expanded' now bound to C+e C+t instead of C+'
  - 'Expand Abbreviation' now bound to C+; instead of C+/
  - 'View Registers' now bound to S+F5 instead of F6
  - 'Delete Paragraph' now bound to C+e d instead of C+e d
- List view removed from browser, only tree view supported

+ Bug Fixes

- Dragging a dockable area to its minimum size is now handled the same
  as collapsing it
- 'Clear Register' action didn't work
- Mode cache wasn't created properly if empty property names were present
- The text area would repaint too much when the caret was being moved,
  which caused a slight slowdown
- 'Open Selection' macro didn't work
- Disabling the 'check file modification status' setting would have no effect

+ API Changes

- JEditTextArea.setOrigin() deprecated. This method should not be called
  anyway.
