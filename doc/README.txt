JEDIT README

* About jEdit

jEdit is an Open Source, cross platform text editor written in Java. It
has many advanced features that make text editing easier, such as syntax
highlighting, auto indent, abbreviation expansion, registers, macros,
regular expressions, and multiple file search and replace.

jEdit requires either Java 1.1 with Swing 1.1, or Java 2 (including the
new JDK 1.3beta) to work.

jEdit uses gnu.regexp by the Free Software Foundation. Only the parts of
gnu.regexp used by jEdit are included - the complete package can be
found at <http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/>.

* jEdit's License

jEdit is released under the GNU General Public License, which can
be found in the COPYING.txt file.

Note that jEdit comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND; see
section 11 and 12 of the GPL for details.

* jEdit on the Internet

The jEdit homepage, located at <http://jedit.sourceforge.net> contains
the latest version of jEdit, along with plugin downloads.

There are three mailing lists dedicated to jEdit; an announcement
list that is very low traffic, a general discussion list, and a
development discussion list. To subscribe, unsubscribe or view list
archives, visit <http://www.sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=588>.

Finally, you may contact me directly by e-mailing <sp@gjt.org>.

* Documentation

jEdit's documentation is written in SGML-DocBook, which is a generic
documentation format that can be coverted to HTML, PDF, PostScript, and
so on.

An HTML version of the documentation is included in the base jEdit
distribution; a pretty PDF version can be obtained from
<http://jedit.sourceforge.net/jedit-download.html>.

To view the HTML version, select `Help->jEdit User Guide' in jEdit, or
open `doc/jeditdocs/index.html' in a WWW browser such as Netscape. To
view the PDF, open jedit-<version>.pdf in a PDF viewer such as Adobe
Acrobat.

* Credits

I would like to thank the following people who have contributed code to
the jEdit core:

Dirk Moebius - Enhanced plugin versioning
Jason Ginchereau - Buffer tabs code
Mike Dillon - XMode syntax highlighting engine, gutter, new options dialog box,
faster literal search, many other patches
Tal Davidson - Original syntax highlighting engine

If you are not on the above list but think you should be, e-mail me.

In addition to the above people, I would like to thank all the people
who wrote edit modes, the plugin developers for their wonderful plugins,
and the users for their feedback and comments.

Have fun!
