* About jEdit

jEdit is an Open Source, cross platform text editor written in Java. It
has many advanced features that make text editing easier, such as syntax
highlighting, auto indent, abbreviation expansion, registers, macros,
regular expressions, and multiple file search and replace.

jEdit requires either Java 1.1 with Swing 1.1, or Java 2 (including the
new JDK 1.3beta) to work.

jEdit uses gnu.regexp by the Free Software Foundation. Only the parts of
gnu.regexp used by jEdit are included - the complete package can be
found at <http://www.cacas.org/java/gnu/regexp/>.
