MAJOR CHANGES IN JEDIT 2.3 SINCE 2.2

* Plugin manager

The 'plugin manager' is a tool for installing, updating and removing
plugins. No more trips to plugin central if you want to install a new
plugin, and no more digging through directories to remove an old one.

* Abbreviations

To make long strings easier to type, you can now define shorthand forms,
which if entered, will expand to the full string, either automatically
(if automatic expansion is enabled) or when the 'Expand Abbreviation'
command is invoked.

* Views can be split

Views can now be split into two different panes, allowing two locations
in a buffer to be viewed at the same time.

* New 'gutter' shows line numbers

The gutter is a strip that runs along the left side of the text area.
It displays line numbers. Plugins can also draw their own highlights
in the gutter. The gutter was written by Mike Dillon <mdillon@gjt.org>.

* Buffer tabs plugin integrated

The BufferTabs plugin has been integrated into the jEdit core. It adds a
series of tabs to views allowing for quick and easy switching between
open buffers.

* Search and replace options on tool bar

Three new buttons have been added to jEdit's tool bar for changing
search and replace settings (regular expressions, ignore case, multiple
file search). As a result, the 'Find' field in the tool bar is much more
useful.

* File->Current Directory menu

The new 'File->Current Directory' menu now lists all files in the
current buffer's directory. Selecting a file will open it for editing.
If the file you want to open is in the current directory, using this
menu is often quicker than the 'File->Open' dialog box.

* Enhanced text selection

You can now select a block of whole words by double-clicking, then
dragging. Whole lines can be selected by triple-clicking and dragging.

* New text editing commands

The following miscellaneous commands have been added:

- Select Word (taken from TextTools plugin by Mike Dillon)
- Select Line
- Select Paragraph
- To Upper Case (taken from TextTools)
- To Lower Case (taken from TextTools)

* Improved HyperSearch

When performing a directory search, the 'HyperSearch' feature no longer
opens all buffers which contained the search string. Instead, buffers
are only opened when the user selects a search result from the list.

* Key bindings can be changed on the fly

Changes to jEdit's key bindings now take effect immediately. In
previous jEdit versions, you had to restart jEdit for changes to take
effect.

* Buffer list sorting

The buffer list can now be optionally sorted alphabetically. When many
buffers are open, this makes the list somewhat easier to navigate.

* Options dialog box updates

The 'Global Options' and 'Plugin Options' dialog boxes have been
merged, and the tabs have been replaced with a tree that displays
all option panes. Plugins can add 'option groups' to the tree, with
each option group containing multiple related option panes. The new
options dialog box was written by Mike Dillon <mdillon@gjt.org>.
