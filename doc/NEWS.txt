MAJOR CHANGES IN JEDIT 2.5 SINCE 2.4

* New I/O subsystem

The file loading and saving code has been completely overhauled in
jEdit 2.5. The code is cleaner and more modular, which should make it
easier to extend in the future. Also, all I/O is now performed in a
separate thread, which improves responsiveness.

* FTP load and save

Taking advantage of the increased modularity of the new I/O code, the
FTP 'virtual filesystem' allows transparent access to files stored on
FTP servers. It supports username/password authentication and browsing
of remote directories.

* Improved split pane feature

It is now possible to edit multiple buffers side-by-side in a split
view. Previously, all splits had to edit the same buffer.

* Changing settings on a mode-by-mode basis

Settings such as the tab size, comment strings, and various flags can
now be set on a mode-by-mode basis in the Utilities->Global Options
dialog box. The patterns used to match file names to modes can be
customized as well.

* Customizable tool bar

The tool bar can now be customized in the Utilities->Global Options
dialog box.

* Searching in file dialog boxes

The 'Open File' and 'Save As' dialog boxes now have a built in 'find
file' widget that supports searching by file name and modification date.
This widget was written by Ken Klinner <kklinner@opiom.com>.

* Register and marker improvements

Markers and position registers are now highlighted in the gutter.
Commands have been added to go to the closest marker before and after
the caret.

* Macro improvements

Macros can now prompt for input. Also, register contents can now be
substituted into action commands by writing '$x', where 'x' is the
desired register.

* HyperSearch improvements

The 'HyperSearch' window now performs searches in a background thread.
This improves percieved performance, gives feedback while the search is
in progress, and allows the search to be interrupted.

* Improved home/end commands

The behaviour of the HOME and END keys has changed. Pressing them
multiple times will now go to the first/last non-whitespace character on
the current line, then the start/end of the current line, and finally the
first/last visible line.

* Background mode

If the '-background' switch is specified on the command line, jEdit will
stay resident and continue running even if no views are open. On systems
with lots of free memory, this improves performance because jEdit only
needs to be loaded once.
