MAJOR CHANGES IN JEDIT 2.1 SINCE 2.0

This file outlines the major changes in jEdit 2.1 since 2.0. A complete
list can be found in the file named CHANGES.txt.

- Keyboard macros. Complex actions can be recorded and played back as
  many times as necessary. Macros are saved across editing sessions.

- Rectangular selection. Columns of text can now be selected and
  operated upon.

- Registers for storing strings and positions inside a buffer. It's like
  having multiple clipboards and anchors.

- Command repeating. Keystrokes and macros can be repeated multiple
  times automatically.

- Python, XML and IDL syntax highlighting.

- Filename filters in 'Open' and 'Save As' dialog boxes.

- RMI server removed, replaced by simpler socket-based edit server. RMI
  had too many quirks and required the user to run the 'rmiregistry'
  daemon.

- New plugin API brings improvements to option panes and Plugins menu
  creation.

- Bundled plugins. The following plugins are now included with jEdit:
  - Console by Slava Pestov
  - HTML by Romain Guy and Slava Pestov
  - JBrowse by George Latkiewicz
  - QuickFile by Jason Ginchereau

- Several areas of jEdit have been optimized for speed:
  - C, HTML syntax highlighting is more efficent
  - File selection dialog boxes should open faster
  - Text area should be more responsive when scrolling and entering text

- Documentation updates. The plugin development section covers much more
  detail. The documentation is now available in PDF format.

There are many more less important changes, as well as bug fixes.
