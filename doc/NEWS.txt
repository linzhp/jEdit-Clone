MAJOR CHANGES IN JEDIT 2.4 SINCE 2.3

* User properties incompatibility

After using the 'Global Options' dialog box in jEdit 2.4, you will no
longer be able to use previous releases of jEdit; they will either
throw exceptions or not work very well. This is because the format of
'on/off' flags and syntax style properties has changed.

* Major syntax highlighting changes

The XMode syntax highlighting system, which allows syntax modes to be
specified using XML, has been integrated into the jEdit core. It makes
writing and debugging syntax modes much easier than before. Many more
modes are now included with jEdit (over 30) and the existing modes are
much more comprehensive. XMode was contributed by Mike Dillon
<mdillon@gjt.org>.

Also, syntax tokens can now be drawn with a background color other than
the default. This can make certain tokens stand out more. The code to
do this was contributed by Andre Kaplan <ak@village.uunet.be>.

* Auto indent improvements

In C-like edit modes (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, IDL), the indent will
be shifted accordingly if the previous line contains an 'if', 'else',
'for', 'while' or 'case' statement.

* Search and replace improvements

A new 'search bar' with incremental search support replaces the find
field on the tool bar. In the 'Multifile Search Options' dialog box,
the default value of the 'directory' field is now set to the current
buffer's parent directory, and the value of the 'filter' field is set
to the current buffer's filename extension.

* Autosave recovery

If you open a file which has autosaved changes, you will be given the
choice to load the autosave file and either save or discard the
autosaved changes.

* Miscellaneous improvements

- It is now possible to have more than one split in a view
- A keystroke switches between the current and most recently edited
  buffer (C+e TAB)
- If you try to open a file which is already open jEdit will offer to
  reload it from disk
- jEdit now checks if the current buffer has changed on disk when it
  gains focus
- The 'Complete Word' command now lists all possible completions in a
  dialog box instead of cycling through them
- The 'Buffer Options' dialog box now displays the buffer-local
  properties corresponding to the currently selected settings
- The current line is highlighted in the gutter
- The 'Global Options' dialog box should load quicker
- The Firewall plugin by Dirk Moebius <dmoebius@gmx.net> is now
  included in the core distribution. The Firewall plugin allows you to
  use the plugin manager from behind a firewall
