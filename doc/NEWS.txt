MAJOR CHANGES IN JEDIT 2.7 SINCE 2.6

* Macro system improvements

The limited macro language used in jEdit 2.6 and earlier has been
replaced with BeanShell. BeanShell is a full-featured scripting language
with a syntax very similar to Java; hence Java programmers will be able
to pick it up very easily. Recording user actions is still supported,
so non-programmers can continue to use of jEdit's macro features.

* User interface improvements

- The buffer switching tabs have been replaced with a combo box
- I/O progress is now displayed in the top-right corner of the editor
  window
- Caret location information is now displayed in the bottom-left corner
  of the text area

* Search and replace improvements

- The search and replace and HyperSearch dialog boxes have been merged
- Multiple line search and replace is now supported
- The jEdit 2.5-style search bar is back.

* Word wrap

jEdit now supports word wrap. Inserting characters beyond a specified
wrap column will automatically insert a line break at the appropriate
location.

* Indent width -vs- tab width

The indent width (used when doing auto indent and shifting lines) and
the tab width (used when displaying tabs) can now be set separately.

* Caret positions saved in recent file list

jEdit now remembers the caret position in recently opened files, and
automatically restores it when a recent file is opened.

* Scrolling commands

The text area can now be scrolled from the keyboard using the commands
in the View->Scrolling menu. (Contributed by Ollie Rutherfurd

* New edit modes

Syntax highlighting was added for the following file types, bringing the
total number of edit modes up to 42:

- Intel x86 assembly (contributed by Kristian Ovaska
  <kristian.ovaska@helsinki.fi>)
- C# (contributed by Ollie Rutherfurd <oliver@rutherfurd.net>)

* FTP support moved to a plugin

FTP support has been moved out of the editor core to the 'FTP' plugin,
which can be installed using the plugin manager.
