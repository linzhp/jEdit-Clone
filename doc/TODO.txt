JEDIT TO DO

- Expand abbreviation sucks:
  - > 1 match on one line doesn't work
  - need to finish match cycling
- Action: shell
- Invoke EditBus commands from macros, macros written using other shells
- Shell interface so that ExecuteCommands are not necessary
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Integrate XMode
- Word wrap. True word-wrap would require significant changes to the text area,
  and would probably slow things down (think yToLine()). Maybe some sort of
  'soft wrap' that inserts newlines into the text could be implemented instead?
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option

------- Installer -------

- Package and release
- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization

------- Ideas for plugins -------

- Version control
- Localizations for specific languages
- Generic EditBus-aware plugin for invoking other programs inside the JVM
- Debugger front-end
- VI key binding emulation
- Menu bar/right-click context menu/toolbar editor
- Spelling checker
- BeanShell is REALLY nifty! Wrap it in a plugin
  - Use EditBus: supports execution from console, error list, etc
  - One interpreter per view
  - It should be possible to write entire plugins in BeanShell. Eg:
    class SomePlugin extends BeanShellPlugin
    {
      public SomePlugin()
      {
        super("SomePlugin.bsh");
      }
    }
    Where SomePlugin.bsh has all the code.
