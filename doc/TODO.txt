JEDIT TO DO

- Option pane for changing mode-specific tab size, indent, comment
  characters, and so on
- DOX: merge basic-file-opts and basic-editing, rename advanced-editing
  to 'Advanced Features'
- EditPlugin.getName()/Version()/Author(), getPath(), getClassName(), etc
  methods
- BrokenPlugin extends EditPlugin, used as a placeholder for broken
  plugins -- implements getPath() and getClassName()
- jEdit.getPlugins() returns broken and non-broken plugins
- 'Uncomment' command that removes comment strings from selected text

- Double-click drag doesn't work backwards
- Fix focus breakage, C+TAB/CS+TAB to navigate around all view components
  except for tool bar buttons
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - document GUIUtilities.load/saveGeometry
  - how to write edit modes and token markers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - each section should have some sample source code

- Incremental search
- Integrate XMode
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Write custom 'document' class; Swing implementation has a few
  problems. With a custom document, folding and such becomes much cleaner
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, locale-sensitive GUI, etc
- Word wrap

When we switch to JDK 1.2, do this:
- drag and drop of files and text
- Use collections instead of MiscUtilities.quicksort()
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- Integrate HTTP proxy support
