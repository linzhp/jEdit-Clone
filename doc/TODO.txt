* Before 3.1pre1

- inserting text causes random problems with folding

- finish persistent splits
- The abbrev option pane will edit the currently selected abbrev in a
  text area.

- visibleLine handling a bit broken
- shortcuts option pane: grabbing keys
- > 1 shortcut per command
- finish \t in abbrevs

* Folding

- expand-one-level command

* XMode rule inclusion

A new tag will be added:

<INCLUDE SET="<ruleset name>" />

This tag will copy all rules from the specified ruleset to the current
ruleset. This will reduce rule duplication by allowing, for example,
XML-derived modes (HTML, ASP, JSP, PHP, ...) to share a common set of
rules.

* More reliable saving

When saving a file, it will first be saved to .<filename>.save, and
only then renamed to <filename> if the save was successful.

* Minor changes

- The File->Current Directory menu will not list backups and autosaves.

- All available fonts will be shown in the font selector.

- The base Metal L&F font will be configurable.

- File system browser: change 'Open in new view' to 'Open in new split'

- Make modifier code keyboard layout-neutral: handle modifier+key char
  in keyTyped()

- Bracket double click behavior is really annoying - make if configurable

* Two-pane view in filesystem browser

* Documentation

- Migrate to DocBook/XML
