JEDIT TO DO

- Keyboard shortcuts for macros
- Record toolbar clicks
- Let user specify minimum log level in the activity log
- Do searching in a background thread
- Low-priority background thread that plugins can use to do background
  parsing, etc: jEdit.addWorkRequest(Runnable r), WorkerThread
- On some Java implementations, scrolling doesn't stop after mouse is released.
  I've only seen this with 2.0, never with 2.1 or 2.2, but it is still reported
  sometimes
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Integrate XMode
- Integrate EditBus if enough plugins take advantage of it. This will also
  mean that jEdit will be able to take advantage of EditBus stuff; for
  example, the buffers menu could display which buffers have errors
- Word wrap. True word-wrap would require significant changes to the text area,
  and would probably slow things down (think yToLine()). Maybe some sort of
  'soft wrap' that inserts newlines into the text could be implemented instead?

------- Installer -------

- Package and release
- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization

------- Ideas for plugins -------

- Version control
- Project manager
- Application/applet/plugin wizard
- Localizations for specific languages
- Generic EditBus-aware plugin for invoking other programs inside the JVM
- Debugger front-end
- VI emulation
- Menu bar/right-click context menu/toolbar editor
- Spelling checker
