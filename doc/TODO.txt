JEDIT TO DO

- CVS: add next-split, prev-split, recent-buffer
- Split panes are a bit broken
- Fix focus breakage, C+TAB/CS+TAB to navigate around all view components
  except for tool bar buttons
- load/saveCaretInfo() save data in split.n.<property name> so that we
  don't have to unsplit when switching buffers, closing, reloading, etc
  - XXX: this will make the caret handling in split() a bit tricky
  - load/saveCaretInfo(int n) -- n=-1 for temporary saving, eg in
    split()
  - sessions???
- File->Current Directory: instead of hardcoding to 20 items max, use screen
  height
- If there is > 1 possible match, complete-word should list them in a
  dialog box
- Write an InputHandler subclass that displays the current repeat count,
  if any, in the view's status bar
- EditPlugin.getName()/Version()/Author(), getPath(), getClassName(), etc
  methods
- BrokenPlugin extends EditPlugin, used as a placeholder for broken
  plugins -- implements getPath() and getClassName()
- jEdit.getPlugins() returns broken and non-broken plugins
- 'Uncomment' command that removes comment strings from selected text
- Option pane for changing mode-specific tab size, indent, comment
  characters, and so on
- Double-click drag doesn't work backwards
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - document GUIUtilities.load/saveGeometry
  - how to write edit modes and token markers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - each section should have some sample source code
- DOX: merge basic-file-opts and basic-editing, rename advanced-editing
  to 'Advanced Features'
- Incremental search
- EditAction.isEnabled() method -- write new EditAction.Model class
- Integrate XMode
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Write custom 'document' class; Swing implementation has a few
  problems. With a custom document, folding and such becomes much cleaner
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, locale-sensitive GUI, etc

------- JDK 1.2 -------

When we switch to JDK 1.2, do this:
- drag and drop of files and text
- Use collections instead of MiscUtilities.quicksort()
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- Wait cursor hack in event queue
- Proper font list in global options
- Integrate HTTP proxy support
