JEDIT TO DO

+ Cleanups

- currently, Macros.java has a huge kudge to implement key bindings for
  macros. This is very stupid, and the menu code needs to be made more
  flexible, so that BeanShell and friends can also have shortcuts (that
  can be edited in the shortcuts option pane!)
- jEdit.getBooleanProperty() for yes/no stuff

+ Features

- s/overwriteSetSelectedText/userInput/g. userInput() performs soft wrap
- execute-command action for invoking EB shell commands from macros
- Shell.waitFor()?
- Write user and developer documentation for EditBus
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Integrate XMode
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- If the BeanShell plugin becomes mature enough, maybe replace built-in macro
  system with it?

------- Installer -------

- Package and release
- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization
- Bad file number I/O error - file descriptor leak somewhere?

------- Ideas for plugins -------

- Version control
- Localizations for specific languages
- Generic EditBus-aware plugin for invoking other programs inside the JVM
- Debugger front-end
- VI key binding emulation
- Spelling checker
