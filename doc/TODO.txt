TO DO

This list is a real mess... Note that not all these changes will be
implemented in jEdit 3.2. Some might appear in a future version, some
might never be implemented at all.

- what to do with boxComment property?
- update buffer history for multiple selection
- reload edit modes command
- start preparing for web start (handle jEditHome == null, jedit_jnlp.jar)
- when loading a plugin, check if all the jars are present?
- 'find' -vs- 'find in files'?
- having no newline at the end of BeanShell scripts causes problems
- finish new plugin manager
- scrollToCaret() doesn't always work
- better docs about multiple selection
- reverse regexp search
- hypersearch: select button, clear button
- XThis: don't throw exceptions for non-existent methods
- caret event not always fired
- folding bug
- most recently deleted text in ^ register?
- web start version
- failed saves should not clear the dirty flag

+ editing
 - improved rectangular selections
 - soft wrap
 - Bracket double click behavior is really annoying - make if configurable

+ folding
 - expand-fold doesn't expand narrowed regions
 - if the first line of the buffer is a collapsed fold: delete, undo,
   text inaccessable until C+e x
 - Perhaps try an alternative implementation of narrowing
 - per-view fold visibility: bit-field used to store this in LineInfo
 - eliminate virtual line map with 'virtualLine' fields in LineInfo
   and binary search in virtualToPhysical()

+ plugins
 - if a plugin is removed and put in a new dir, it is shown in both the
   update and install lists
 - zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
 - display all plugin errors, batched in one window on startup
 - move latest version plugin into the core, improve latest version plugin
 - move plugin manager into the core
 - plugin manager: track dependencies, branches

+ syntax highlighting
 - only exit delegates at the top level (eg <?php "<?xml ...?>" ?> in PHP)
 - XMode rule inclusion
 - regexps in XMode

+ io
 - can mini io progress, io progress command
 - display io progress automatically after > 1 sec I/O
 - move local fs-specific stuff from MiscUtilities to FileVFS (UrlVFS
   calls getParentOfPath()?)
 - encoding option in VFS browser
 - when saving local files, save to .<filename>.save, then rename to
   <filename>; maybe backups on non-local fs's (but then would have to
   eliminate numbered backup support)
 - aborts not always fired
 - encoding option in VFS browser
 - Two-pane view in filesystem browser

+ ui
 - ensure find field doesn't get too large
 - finish persistent splits
 - The base Metal L&F font will be configurable.
 - use Dirk's VariableGridLayout more
 - escape in 'add abbrev' dialog
 - fix dragStart handling in DockableWindowContainer.TabbedPane
 - C+i in shortcuts editor
 - 'new view' creates incorrectly sized views due to Java bugs
 - status bar for displaying readNextChar() prompts

+ beanshell
 - improve handling of __char__

+ documentation
 - get rid of final blank page of user's guide
 - Migrate documentation to DocBook/XML
 - update macro guide for misc. API changes:
   - markers, registers, should probably be mentioned?
   - s&r changes
   - new select API
 - Include John's upcoming plugin guide
