JEDIT TO DO

------- Cleanups -------

- currently, Macros.java has a huge kudge to implement key bindings for
  macros. This is very stupid, and the menu code needs to be made more
  flexible, so that BeanShell and friends can also have shortcuts (that
  can be edited in the shortcuts option pane!)
- jEdit.getBooleanProperty() for yes/no stuff
- Higlight.paintHighlight(): instead of passing y co-ordinate, pass a
  rectangle with line bounds
- Macro recording is a crock of sh*t. Eg:
  C+ENTER 5 b c will give us "bbbbbc", but when recorded and played
  back, comes out as "bcbcbcbcbc". Also, find-next and other actions that
  record themselves "manually" cannot be repeated

------- Features -------

- Word wrap
- Clean way of embedding token markers in one another, so that HTMLTokenMarker
  can also colorize VBScript, etc
- Document EditBus in plugin development docs
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Integrate XMode
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option

------- Installer -------

- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization
- Bad file number I/O error - file descriptor leak somewhere?
