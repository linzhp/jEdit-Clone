JEDIT 2.2 TO DO

- Document activity log in user and devel guide
- Low-priority background thread that plugins can use to do background
  parsing, etc: jEdit.addWorkRequest(Runnable r), WorkerThread
- Directory list set is slow; investigate exactly what happends in openFile()
  and closeBuffer()
- On some Java implementations, scrolling doesn't stop after mouse is released
- Reverse search
- Integrate XMode
- Integrate EditBus if enough plugins take advantage of it
- Word wrap
- Finish XGL and use it in jEdit

------- Installer -------

- Submit to CVS
- Package and release
- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization

------- Ideas for plugins -------

- Version control
- Project manager
- Application/applet/plugin wizard
- Localizations for specific languages
- Generic EditBus-aware plugin for invoking other programs inside the JVM
- Debugger front-end
- VI emulation
- Menu bar/right-click context menu/toolbar editor
