JEDIT TO DO

------- 2.3 to do -------

- Focus breaks when saving or switching buffers

------- 2.4 to do -------

- Double-click drag doesn't work backwards
- Option pane for changing mode-specific tab size, indent, comment
  characters, and so on
- EditAction.isEnabled() method
- Check file modification status on focus and buffer switch
  - Buffer.checkModStatus() method
- Having more than 2 split panes should be possible
- load/saveCaretInfo() save data in split.n.<property name> so that we
  don't have to unsplit when switching buffers, closing, reloading, etc
  - XXX: this will make the caret handling in split() a bit tricky
  - load/saveCaretInfo(int n) -- n=-1 for temporary saving, eg in
    split()
- If there is > 1 possible match, complete-word should list them in a
  dialog box
- 'Uncomment' command that removes comment strings from selected text
- Write an InputHandler subclass that displays the current repeat count,
  if any, in the view's status bar
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - document GUIUtilities.load/saveGeometry
  - how to write edit modes and token markers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - each section should have some sample source code
- DOX: merge basic-file-opts and basic-editing, rename advanced-editing
  to 'Advanced Features'
- Menu bar and tool bar loading needs to work outside of views
- Changing key bindings should update menu item labels

------- jEdit 3.0 to do -------

- Integrate XMode
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Maybe write custom 'document' class; Swing implementation has a few
  problems. With a custom document, folding and such becomes much cleaner
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, locale-sensitive GUI, etc
- Hex file editing

------- JDK 1.2 -------

When we switch to JDK 1.2, do this:
- drag and drop of files and text
- Use collections instead of MiscUtilities.quicksort()
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- Wait cursor hack in event queue
- Proper font list in global options
- Integrate HTTP proxy support
