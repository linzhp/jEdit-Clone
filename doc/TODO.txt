+ grave
 - inserting text causes random problems with folding
 - undo causes problems sometimes (is this related to folding at all?)
 - sometimes fold markers are not repainted in gutter
 - scrolling bug
 - replace all fucks shit up
 - press enter on a fold start line fucks up
 - scrollbar bug

+ important
 - document Startup macro
 - update to new gnu.regexp version
 - finish persistent splits
 - finish \t in abbrevs
 - Folding/narrowing docs - in source-edit.sgml
 - confirm() method in GUIUtilities
 - .description plugin property
 - Migrate documentation to DocBook/XML

+ not really
 - XMode rule inclusion
 - when saving local files, save to .<filename>.save, then rename to
   <filename>
 - The base Metal L&F font will be configurable.
 - Bracket double click behavior is really annoying - make if configurable
 - Two-pane view in filesystem browser
 - Perhaps try an alternative implementation of narrowing
