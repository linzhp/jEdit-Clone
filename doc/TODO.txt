JEDIT TO DO

+ Features

- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - faster tokenizing of files
  - write docs
  - regexps
  - graphical mode/grammar editor
  - digit highlighting
  - get rid of WHITESPACE rule
  - maybe add highlight levels; the higher the level, the more stuff is
    highlighted
- Update existing modes to take advantage of new token types
- 'Uncomment' command that removes comment strings from selected text
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - document GUIUtilities.load/saveGeometry
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - each section should have some sample source code
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Write custom 'document' class; Swing implementation has a few
  problems. With a custom document, folding and such becomes much cleaner
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, locale-sensitive GUI, etc
- Word wrap

+ Enhancements

- Update window-editor-*, dialog-options-styles shots
- EditPlugin.getName()/Version()/Author(), getPath(), getClassName(), etc
  methods
- BrokenPlugin extends EditPlugin, used as a placeholder for broken
  plugins -- implements getPath() and getClassName()
- jEdit.getPlugins() returns broken and non-broken plugins

+ Bug Fixes

- Double-click drag doesn't work backwards
- Fix focus breakage, C+TAB/CS+TAB to navigate around all view components
  except for tool bar buttons

When we switch to JDK 1.2, do this:
- drag and drop of files and text
- Use collections instead of MiscUtilities.quicksort()
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- Integrate HTTP proxy support
