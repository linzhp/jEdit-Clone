JEDIT TO DO

2.5:

- do MARK_PREVIOUS after markKeyword()
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
- Editable toolbar
- Add macros to context menu and toolbar
- XML-driven auto indent
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
- Mode editor
- Piece content
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- Buffer tabs:
  - trunicate long file names (should be configurable)
  - customizable font size?
- Customizable undo queue size
- 'input' action: eg: 'input@a@Enter your name:' would store the user's
  input in register 'a', or clear it if they clicked 'Cancel'

Later:

- New document model
- Folding
- Word wrap
- Reverse search
- Files should be opened and saved in a background thread. HyperSearch should
  be threaded as well
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Pluggable 'Storage' interfaces. We could have 'FTPStorage',
  'FileStorage', 'URLStorage', 'SSHStorage', 'ZIPStorage', 'CVSStorage', etc

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
