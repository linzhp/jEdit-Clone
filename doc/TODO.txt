JEDIT TO DO

2.5:

- Document 'find file' widget
- Search bar is too tall
- Increase file chooser's preferred size
- Redo window-editor screenshots
- Closed views leak memory a rusty bucket
- Plugin manager: use swing centering code, JARClassLoader.getLoaded() method
- Abortable I/O
- Editable toolbar
- Add macros to context menu and toolbar
- Annoying BufferTabs flicker
- Make HyperSearch a JFrame
- Improve FtpBrowser; add bookmarks, filtering, etc
- text area doesn't lose focus sometimes
- TokenMarker: MARK_PREVIOUS should mark to lastOffset not lastKeyword
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, edit panes, buffers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - document VFS stuff
- Mode editor
- Buffer tabs:
  - trunicate long file names (should be configurable)
  - customizable font size?
  - focus is still screwed with JDK 1.3
- Threaded HyperSearch
- set dirty to false when all undos undone

Later:

- Pluggable input handlers
- New document model
- Folding
- Word wrap
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?
- Improve markers -- next/prev-marker commands, highlight markers and
  registers in the gutter, buffer-local property to disable marker
  persistance

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
