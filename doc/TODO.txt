JEDIT TO DO

* jEdit 2.6

Major stuff:

- Bracket matching code doesn't pay attention to comments, string literals,
  etc. It would be nice if its parser was a bit more intelligent
- FTP VFS improvements:
  - threaded browser with bookmarks
  - improve symlink handling in browser
  - display FTP responses in status bar
  - filename filters in FTP browser
- Printing improvements:
  - option pane for setting margins, print font, toggling header/footer
  - 'Print Selection' command
  - option for printing line numbers
- Adding macros to context menu and toolbar:
  - Macros become full-blown actions; macro-<xxx>. List is maintained in
    Macros class; they are *not* added to jEdit's action list
  - Some stuff will be simplified if an EditAction.getLabel() method is
    added
- Improve rectangular selections:
  - end of selection can be last the end of the line
  - hack offsetToX()/xToOffset() to accept 'pastEOL' parameter, which
    toggles 'virtual' spaces after the end of the line
  - JEditTextArea.getSelectedTextOnLine(int line) method returns selection
    on line 'line' (no virtual spaces at the end)
- Documentation:
  - document view, edit pane, buffer API
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - write VFS developer docs
  - document EditBus plugin
- Pluggable input handlers
- 'autosave' session created by autosave thread, deleted on exit. When jEdit
  is started, it checks for this session, if it exists, it prompts if the
  files should be recovered

Minor tweaks:

- Plugin manager should remove files for real, instead of moving them to
  a 'backup' directory
- Switch to DocBook 4.0 for the documentation
- Prettify options dialog boxes with JLF guidelines
- Buffer-local property to disable marker persistance
- ModeComboBox class
- Maybe simplify threaded I/O code a bit

* jEdit 3.0 and later

- Word wrap
- Abortable I/O
- Folding
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
- New document model
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?
- Mode grammar editor
- Set dirty to false when all undos undone (will be easy with new document
  model)
- New preferences system for easier storage of non-string values
- -session= parameter should work even if files were specified on the
  command line. More than one -session parameter should be supported

* When we switch to Java 2

- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
