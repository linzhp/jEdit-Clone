JEDIT TO DO

2.5:

- MarkerHighlight: when a buffer changes, invalidate the highlight cache
- Document MarkerHighlight
- next/prev-marker commands
- Buffer-local property to disable marker persistance
- gutter repaints all lines, it should only repaint necessary ones
- CVS: add RegistersChanged, ScrollEvent, ScrollListener, MarkerHighlight
- Can't follow symlinks in FTP browser
- Increase file chooser's preferred size
- Annoying BufferTabs flicker
- text area doesn't lose focus sometimes
- Documentation:
  - document view, edit pane, buffer API
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - write VFS developer docs
  - document RegistersChanged
  - document EditBus plugin
- Buffer tabs focus is still screwed with JDK 1.3
- Switch to DocBook 4.0 for the documentation

Later:

- Word wrap
- Abortable I/O
- get rid of EnhancedDialog, EnhancedFrame; write EnterEscapeHandler
  and EnterEscapeContainer classes
- ModeComboBox class
- -session= parameter should work even if files were specified on the
  command line. More than one -session parameter should be supported
- Pluggable input handlers
- Folding
- Add macros to context menu and toolbar
- Improve FtpBrowser; add bookmarks, filtering, make it threaded, etc
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
  - MARK_PREVIOUS should mark to lastOffset not lastKeyword
- New document model
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?
- Mode grammar editor
- Set dirty to false when all undos undone (will be easy with new document
  model)
- Bracket matching code doesn't pay attention to comments, string literals,
  etc. It would be nice if its parser was a bit more intelligent
- New preferences system for easier storage of non-string values

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
