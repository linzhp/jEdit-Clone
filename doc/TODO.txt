JEDIT TO DO

+ Features

- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
  - graphical mode/grammar editor
  - do MARK_PREVIOUS before markKeyword()
- 'Uncomment' command that removes comment strings from selected text
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Write custom 'document' class; Swing implementation has a few
  problems. With a custom document, folding and such becomes much cleaner
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, locale-sensitive GUI, etc
- Word wrap
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - document GUIUtilities.load/saveGeometry
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites

+ Enhancements

- EditPlugin.getName()/Version()/Author(), getPath(), getClassName(), etc
  methods
- BrokenPlugin extends EditPlugin, used as a placeholder for broken
  plugins -- implements getPath() and getClassName()
- jEdit.getPlugins() returns broken and non-broken plugins

+ Bug Fixes

- Fix focus breakage, C+TAB/CS+TAB to navigate around all view components
  except for tool bar buttons
- Double-click drag doesn't work backwards
- Untitled files not replaced sometimes?

When we switch to JDK 1.2, do this:
- drag and drop of files and text
- Use collections instead of MiscUtilities.quicksort()
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- Integrate HTTP proxy support
