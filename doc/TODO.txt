JEDIT TO DO

2.5:

- VFS:
  - Show wait cursor only once for a set of requests
  - Filter events in view to implement ESCAPE, etc
  - FTP VFS GUI
  - Abortable FTP
  - If an error occurs while saving, we shouldn't clear the dirty flag
    (VFSManager.waitForRequests() returns a boolean value. If it is false,
    _closeFile() doesn't close the buffer)
  - Write VFS docs - user and developer
  - Annoying BufferTabs flicker

- JEditTextArea.CaretUndo: set textArea reference to null when it is removed?
- text area doesn't lose focus sometimes
- there are still problems with multiline tokens
- TokenMarker: MARK_PREVIOUS should mark to lastOffset not lastKeyword
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
- Editable toolbar
- Add macros to context menu and toolbar - hack loadMenuItem() to handle
  play-macro@... specially
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
- Mode editor
- Buffer tabs:
  - trunicate long file names (should be configurable)
  - customizable font size?
- 'input' action: eg: 'input@a@Enter your name:' would store the user's
  input in register 'a', or clear it if they clicked 'Cancel'
- Threaded HyperSearch
- Backup directory: preserve full paths
- set dirty to false when all undos undone
- move InputHandler to gui package and implement key handling in View
  (but let child components handle events first!!!)
- Rename comment actions to make them more obvious:
  wing comment -> comment
  block comment -> line comment

Later:

- New document model
- Folding
- Word wrap
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
