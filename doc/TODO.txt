TO DO

+ before 3.1final
 - proofread macro guide
 - get rid of final blank page of user's guide

+ sometime in the future
 - improve handling of __char__
 - print() in BeanShell
 - check beanshell import stuff
 - magic caret code a bit annoying
 - fix dragStart handling in DockableWindowContainer.TabbedPane
 - better reverse search from search bar
 - wing comment with rect sel active puts comment start/end at the
   beginning/end of each selected chunk
 - can mini io progress, io progress command
 - display io progress automatically after > 1 sec I/O
 - find next/prev occurrence commands in core, instead of macros
 - reverse regexp search
 - C+i in shortcuts editor
 - expand-fold doesn't expand narrowed regions
 - macro performance sucks
 - if a plugin is removed and put in a new dir, it is shown in both the
   update and install lists
 - zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
 - aborts not always fired
 - ensure find field doesn't get too large
 - move local fs-specific stuff from MiscUtilities to FileVFS (UrlVFS
   calls getParentOfPath()?)
 - finish persistent splits
 - .description plugin property
 - Migrate documentation to DocBook/XML
 - if the first line of the buffer is a collapsed fold: delete, undo,
   text inaccessable until C+e x
 - use Dirk's VariableGridLayout
 - BeanShell class uses deprecated showFileDialog() method
 - XMode rule inclusion
 - when saving local files, save to .<filename>.save, then rename to
   <filename>
 - The base Metal L&F font will be configurable.
 - Bracket double click behavior is really annoying - make if configurable
 - Two-pane view in filesystem browser
 - Perhaps try an alternative implementation of narrowing
 - encoding option in VFS browser
 - per-view fold visibility: bit-field used to store this in LineInfo
 - eliminate virtual line map with 'virtualLine' fields in LineInfo
   and binary search in virtualToPhysical()
 - escape in 'add abbrev' dialog
 - search in selection option; find-next disabled, hypersearch, replace-all
   ok, replace button does same thing???
 - option for auto wrap around in search
 - display all plugin errors, batched in one window on startup
 - move plugin manager into the core?
 - 'new view' creates incorrectly sized views due to Java bugs
