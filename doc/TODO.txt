TO DO

+ would be nice to have before pre6:

- new xToOffset()
- don't show replace all results when running from macro
- pre6 will be the last pre-release before 3.2final.
- console: add go to console action
- console 3.0: MUST FINISH!!!
- document new macro layout!!!
- mention using Macros.message() in macro-tips
- some macros removed:
  Go_to_Clipper
  Go_to_JBrowse
  Go_to_Console
  Show_Dual_Diff
- reload: preserve caret position
- finish duplicate shortcut code
- FTP plugin: investigate soft links
- FTP plugin: better error messages
- FTP plugin: improve it in general before 3.2
- installing source for already installed plugins

+ lower priority/later:

- make XML plugin more respectable
- get web start to work, and document differences between web start and
  stand-alone version
- next time i'm making an RPM, fix the shell script
- jEditLauncher

+ bugs that need to be fixed at some stage:

- a line consisting entirely of spaces & word wrap
- switching option panes real fast
- fix '... is not a function name' when running openjade
- popup menus; make sure they are on-screen? GUIUtilities method?
- does loading and saving user settings take a long time?
- only exit delegates at the top level (eg <?php echo "<?xml ...?>" ?>
  in PHP)
- vfs browser: >1 request error when clicking 'up'?
- broken reverse search?
- prev line fold gutter bug
- tabbing to text area fails
- zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
- failed saves should not clear the dirty flag
- see if new beanshell fixes trailing \n bug
- get rid of final blank page of user's guide
- aborts not always fired
- fix dragStart handling in DockableWindowContainer.TabbedPane
- folding paint up bug
- offsetToX() returning wrong location with some Java versions
- expand-fold too aggressive
- replace in sel doesn't work if rect
- formatting problems in user's guide in table cells
- macro guide: JOptionPane not a good idea for getting user input?

+ later:

- save markers on close and don't set dirty flag
- custom splitter control?
- swing font customization
- much better rect select, along the lines of 'column mode'
- scrolling while caret is on a bracket over long distances slows things
  down
- status bar: show recording status, line separator?
- macros in web start version
- scroll lock key toggles 'scroll mode'
- rewritten folding: Fold object, pointer to next of curr. level, each
  text area has visibility hashtable
- explicit folding
- fold browser
- when loading a plugin, check if all the jars are present?
- regexps in XMode
- DELEGATE in EOL_SPAN
- PHP mode: <?php echo "<?xml version='1.0'?>" ?>
- reverse regexp search
- a 'reinsertOnNextLine' regexp for hard word wrap?
- soft wrap
- support Shift-clicks in JTextComponents (impossible?)
- support jEdit keyboard shortcuts in JTextComponents
- support middle mouse button clicks in JTextComponents
- docking improvements:
  - multiple instances of a dockable
  - make dockable menu items not be toggles.
    - if floating, open new instance.
    - if docked, go to existing instance, if not open, then open
  - create non-menu 'toggle' actions, for those who want them
  - each dockable has a close box in its tool bar; or a button that
    shows a menu, with commands for moving the dockable, making it
    floating, toggling auto-open, etc.
  - require that each dockable have a tool bar with a close button?
- per-mode encodings and line endings
- globalColors setting:
  - tree controls, file system browser icons, tool bar icons look a bit
    ugly with different backgrounds
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
  - updateUI doesn't update tree colors
  - restart should not be necessary for 'globalColors' to take effect
- maybe rewrite file restore to use XML -- allow plugins to read/write
  arbitriary restore files? -- eg BufferList
- finish persistent splits: resize splits to put them in the middle
- edit server documentation
- invert selection
- hypersearch: select lines with matches
- support for more token types, and in HTML mode, highlight different tag
  types with different colors
- {MARKUP,KEYWORD,COMMENT,LITERAL,OPERATOR,LABEL,FUNCTION}{1,2,3,4} token
  types
- new document model with sliding line map
- keyboard selection in hypersearch
- HTML mode: handle <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="..."> in a more flexible manner
- fs browser: details view
- fs browser: two pane view
- JTreeTable control?
