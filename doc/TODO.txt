JEDIT TO DO

2.5:

- VFS:
  - abort I/O requests with special IOAbort throwable which IORequest
    catches at top level
  - Show wait cursor only once for a set of requests
  - Annoying flickering when setEnabled() called
  - ESCAPE should abort I/O
  - Cursor momentarily jumps to end of buffer on load
  - File->Open from and File->Save to menus
  - Marker saving doesn't work

- text area doesn't lose focus sometimes
- there are still problems with multiline tokens
- TokenMarker: MARK_PREVIOUS should mark to lastOffset not lastKeyword
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
- Editable toolbar
- Add macros to context menu and toolbar
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
- Mode editor
- Buffer tabs:
  - trunicate long file names (should be configurable)
  - customizable font size?
- 'input' action: eg: 'input@a@Enter your name:' would store the user's
  input in register 'a', or clear it if they clicked 'Cancel'
- Threaded HyperSearch
- Backup directory: preserve full paths

Later:

- New document model
- Folding
- Word wrap
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
