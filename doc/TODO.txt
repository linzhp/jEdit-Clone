JEDIT TO DO

CVS: Abbrevs.java, default.abbrevs, insert-char in actions package

------- Stuff for 2.3pre1 -------

+ Cleanups / Fixes

- CaretUndo acts weird on 'redo' sometimes

+ Features

- [REMIND]: before releasing pre1, disable abbrevs by default as not to
  confuse users

- Edit abbrevs in global options

- Document static abbrevs

- Integrate BufferTabs into the core

- Integrate Mike Dillon's "Gutter" code, rename TextAreaPainter.Highlight
  to TextAreaHighlight and use that same interface to paint stuff in the
  gutter

- Write an InputHandler subclass that displays the current repeat count,
  if any, in the view's status bar

------- After 2.3pre1 -------

- (??? WHY?) Higlight.paintHighlight(): instead of passing y co-ordinate,
  pass a rectangle with line bounds. Maybe rework TextAreaPainter internals
  to use a rectangle also, it could simplify some things. If one rectangle
  instance is stored and reused, it would not slow things down
- Beef up 'Marker' class to support this sort of file/line number/message
  thing, EditBus will also use it for errors
- HyperSearch - when doing a directory search, all buffers with matches
  are kept open, they should be closed (fixing this is non-trivial!)
- Clean way of embedding token markers in one another, so that HTMLTokenMarker
  can be used to color PHP, ASP, VBScript, etc in addition to JavaScript
- Macros -- \n, \t in action command, indent-on-enter/-tab record themselves
  as insert-char@\n and @\t if disabled
- Buttons on tool bar for ignore case, regexp, multifile options
- 'Uncomment' command, removes comment strings from selected text
- Bookmarks and history window in help viewer
- context-sensitive edit modes - Buffer.getMode(int line) method. For example,
  pressing C+e C+c will insert /* */ in an HTML SCRIPT tag, but <!-- --> in
  normal HTML
- Menu bar and tool bar loading needs to work outside of views
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Integrate XMode
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- Document EditBus in plugin development docs

------- Installer to do -------

- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization
- Bad file number I/O error - file descriptor leak somewhere?
