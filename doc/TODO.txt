* Folding

- expand-one-level command
- inserting text causes random problems with folding
- undo causes problems sometimes (is this related to folding at all?)
- sometimes fold markers are not repainted in gutter
- visibleLine handling a bit broken

* XMode rule inclusion

A new tag will be added:

<INCLUDE SET="<ruleset name>" />

This tag will copy all rules from the specified ruleset to the current
ruleset. This will reduce rule duplication by allowing, for example,
XML-derived modes (HTML, ASP, JSP, PHP, ...) to share a common set of
rules.

* More reliable saving

When saving a file, it will first be saved to .<filename>.save, and
only then renamed to <filename> if the save was successful.

* Minor changes

- The File->Current Directory menu will not list backups and autosaves.
- All available fonts will be shown in the font selector.
- The base Metal L&F font will be configurable.
- File system browser: change 'Open in new view' to 'Open in new split'
- Make modifier code keyboard layout-neutral: handle modifier+key char
  in keyTyped()
- Bracket double click behavior is really annoying - make if configurable
- finish persistent splits
- finish \t in abbrevs
- initial open bug still exists with brackets
- Binding to <any prefix> SPACE doesn't work

* Two-pane view in filesystem browser

* Documentation

- Migrate to DocBook/XML
- Update docs for 3.1 goodies
