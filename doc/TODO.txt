JEDIT TO DO

2.5pre2:

- Closed views leak memory a rusty bucket
- Plugin manager: use swing centering code, JARClassLoader.getLoaded() method
- Abortable I/O
- Write VFS docs - user and developer
- Editable toolbar
- Add macros to context menu and toolbar - hack loadMenuItem() to handle
  play-macro@... specially
- $x in macro action command will expand to contents of register 'x'

2.5:

- Annoying BufferTabs flicker
- Make HyperSearch a JFrame
- Improve FtpBrowser; add bookmarks, filtering, etc
- text area doesn't lose focus sometimes
- TokenMarker: MARK_PREVIOUS should mark to lastOffset not lastKeyword
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
- Mode editor
- Buffer tabs:
  - trunicate long file names (should be configurable)
  - customizable font size?
- Threaded HyperSearch
- set dirty to false when all undos undone

Later:

- Pluggable input handlers
- New document model
- Folding
- Word wrap
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
