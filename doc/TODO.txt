JEDIT TO DO

------- 2.3 to do -------

- Double-click drag doesn't work backwards
- CaretUndo doesn't work on 'redo'
- Check file modification status on focus
- Document gutter
- Update window-editor-* screenshots
- Update dialog-options-* screenshots
- Merge in mike's latest gutter updates
- Fix gutter repaint bug

------- Later -------

- Having more than 2 split panes should be possible
- load/saveCaretInfo() save data in split.n.<property name> so that we
  don't have to unsplit when switching buffers, closing, reloading, etc
- Incremental search
- If there is > 1 possible match, complete-word should list them in a
  dialog box
- 'Uncomment' command that removes comment strings from selected text
- Beef up 'Marker' class to support file/line number/message stuff, EditBus
  will also use it for errors
- Write an InputHandler subclass that displays the current repeat count,
  if any, in the view's status bar
- Don't just blindly call updateBracketHighlight() all the time, only
  call it if bracket highlighted region becomes dirty
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - document GUIUtilities.load/saveGeometry
  - how to write edit modes and token markers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
- Menu bar and tool bar loading needs to work outside of views
- Integrate XMode
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Folding

------- JDK 1.2 -------

When we switch to JDK 1.2, do this:
- drag and drop of files and text
- input method support in text area
- Use collections instead of MiscUtilities.quicksort()
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option
- Wait cursor hack in event queue
- Proper font list in global options
