TO DO

- FTP plugin: soft links???
- FTP plugin: make a 3.2 version with better error messages?
- make xml plugin more respectable before 3.2final

+ before 3.2pre6:

- installing source for already installed plugins
- update macros for new BeanShell implied imports
- writing modes part of user's guide:
  - xml-primer
  - writing-modes
  - mode-tips
    - delegate techniques
      - start/end different from contents
      - balancing brackets
    - ... what else?
  - installing-modes
  - mention delegation to rulesets with TERMINATE_AT
- documentation:
  - update using-plugins
  - formatting problems in user's guide in table cells
  - document differences between web start and stand-alone version
  - JOptionPane not a good idea for getting user input?
  - proofread documentation
- finish duplicate shortcut code
- save markers on close and don't set dirty flag

+ before 3.2final:

- get web start to work
- fix '... is not a function name' when running openjade
- reload: preserve caret position
- next time i'm making an RPM, fix the shell script
- jEditLauncher

+ bugs that need to be fixed at some stage:

- popup menus; make sure they are on-screen? GUIUtilities method?
- does loading and saving user settings take a long time?
- help viewer: links to .txt files?
- Java 1.4 key events: DefaultInputHandler?
- XThis: don't throw exceptions for non-existent methods
- only exit delegates at the top level (eg <?php echo "<?xml ...?>" ?>
  in PHP)
- need to track down s.end < s.start cases
- vfs browser: >1 request error when clicking 'up'?
- italics font metrics bugs
- broken reverse search?
- text style bugs
- caret event not always fired
- prev line fold gutter bug
- tabbing to text area fails
- zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
- failed saves should not clear the dirty flag
- see if new beanshell fixes trailing \n bug
- get rid of final blank page of user's guide
- aborts not always fired
- fix dragStart handling in DockableWindowContainer.TabbedPane
- caret undo bugs
- folding paint up bug
- offsetToX() returning wrong location with some Java versions
- expand-fold too aggressive
- replace in sel doesn't work if rect

+ later:

- custom splitter control?
- swing font customization
- much better rect select, along the lines of 'column mode'
- scrolling while caret is on a bracket over long distances slows things
  down
- status bar: show recording status, line separator?
- macros in web start version
- scroll lock key toggles 'scroll mode'
- rewritten folding: Fold object, pointer to next of curr. level, each
  text area has visibility hashtable
- explicit folding
- fold browser
- when loading a plugin, check if all the jars are present?
- regexps in XMode
- improve handling of DIGIT sequences
- DELEGATE in EOL_SPAN
- reverse regexp search
- a 'reinsertOnNextLine' regexp for hard word wrap?
- soft wrap
- support Shift-clicks in JTextComponents (impossible?)
- support jEdit keyboard shortcuts in JTextComponents
- support middle mouse button clicks in JTextComponents
- docking improvements:
  - multiple instances of a dockable
  - make dockable menu items not be toggles.
    - if floating, open new instance.
    - if docked, go to existing instance, if not open, then open
  - create non-menu 'toggle' actions, for those who want them
  - each dockable has a close box in its tool bar; or a button that
    shows a menu, with commands for moving the dockable, making it
    floating, toggling auto-open, etc.
  - require that each dockable have a tool bar with a close button?
- per-mode encodings and line endings
- globalColors setting:
  - tree controls, file system browser icons, tool bar icons look a bit
    ugly with different backgrounds
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
  - updateUI doesn't update tree colors
  - restart should not be necessary for 'globalColors' to take effect
- maybe rewrite file restore to use XML -- allow plugins to read/write
  arbitriary restore files? -- eg BufferList
- finish persistent splits: resize splits to put them in the middle
- C+\
- edit server documentation
- invert selection
- hypersearch: select lines with matches
- support for more token types, and in HTML mode, highlight different tag
  types with different colors
- {MARKUP,KEYWORD,COMMENT,LITERAL,OPERATOR,LABEL,FUNCTION}{1,2,3,4} token
  types
- new document model with sliding line map
- keyboard selection in hypersearch
