JEDIT TO DO

* 2.1 TODO:

- Plugin devel:
  - GUIUtilities.message/error/input/inputProperty
  - Edit modes
  - Token markers
  - Views
  - Buffers
  - The text area

- Slow scrolling

* 2.2+ TODO:

- Macro recorder
  - Write the following actions:
    - set-search-string
    - set-replace-string
    - set-search-parameters (regexp, icase, {current,all})
  - Macros bound to events?

- Close dialog box that lists all dirty buffers
  - Save, Discard, Cancel buttons
  - Clicking on a buffer in the list will switch to that buffer in the
    view

- Recording and repeating menu items

- Recursive directory search

- More intelligent auto indent

- Reverse search. This will require changes to gnu.regexp

- Drop support for JDK 1.1 and use collections, input methods, etc
  JDK 1.3 supports PNG images, so we will be able to drop GIFs soon!

- Integrate XMode

- Integrate EditBus if enough plugins take advantage of it
