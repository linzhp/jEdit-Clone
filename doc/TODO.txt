JEDIT TO DO

- do MARK_PREVIOUS before markKeyword()
- write 'indentPrevLine' regexp for Perl mode, maybe others
- Double-click drag doesn't work backwards
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
  - mode editor
- Reverse search
- New document model
- Word wrap
- Folding
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, locale-sensitive GUI, etc
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, buffers
  - document GUIUtilities.load/saveGeometry
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
- Editable toolbar and context menu
- Possible auto indent improvements:
  - don't do indentation inside comments
  - skip brackets in string literals
  - automatically shift indent left the line after one indented using
    'indentPrevLine'
  - 'unindentThisLine' regexp

When we switch to JDK 1.2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
- Integrate HTTP proxy support
