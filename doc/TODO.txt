JEDIT TO DO

- 'startup.action' property, executed when jEdit started with no files
  on command line. Can be 'new-file', 'open-file', 'load-desktop', etc.

- View.show/hideWaitCursor(): increments waitCount for nested operation
  (use in save-all)

- Macro recorder
  - Write the following actions:
    - set-search-string
    - set-replace-string
    - set-search-parameters (regexp, icase, {current,all})
  - Macros bound to events?

- Close dialog box that lists all dirty buffers
  - Save, Discard, Cancel buttons
  - Clicking on a buffer in the list will switch to that buffer in the
    view

- Recording and repeating menu items
  - Could be implemented by giving menu items a 'proxy' action listener
    that performed repetition and recording, and then passed the event
    to the action

- Recursive directory search

- More intelligent auto indent

- Mode system changes: mode.XXX.filename-glob: all filenames globbed against
  this property. mode.XXX.firstline-glob: corresponding glob for first line
  of file

- Reverse search. This will require changes to gnu.regexp

- Drop support for JDK 1.1 and use collections, input methods, etc
  JDK 1.3 supports PNG images, so we will be able to drop GIFs soon!

- Integrate XMode

- Integrate EditBus if enough plugins take advantage of it
