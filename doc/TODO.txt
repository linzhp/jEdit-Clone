TO DO

- FTP plugin: soft links???
- FTP plugin: make a 3.2 version with better error messages?

- console plugin, version 3.0:
  - sending processes to background:
    %fg <n> - send <n> to foreground
    %bg - send current to background
    %kill <n>
    %kill - kill <n> or current
    cmd & - runs cmd in background
  - each console should be able to have it's own process
  - deleting backup files
  - aliases:
    - option pane, or %alias/%unalias commands
  - variables:
    - each variable is a BeanShell snippet
    - option pane, or %set/%unset commands
  - include Java versions of ls, rm, mv, cp, maybe a few others
    - names prefixed with %; %ls, %mv, etc?
    - above always possible; option for not having to use % prefix
  - wild cards
  - what about \"foo\"?
  - some % commands can be used without % prefix; clear, cd, pwd

+ before pre4:

- don't invoke updateUI unnecessarily
- jEditLauncher
- get web start to work
- fix 'is not a function name' when running openjade
- installing source for already installed plugins

+ before 3.2final:

- custom splitter control?
- finish persistent splits: resize splits to make them in the middle
- documentation
  - mention registers in API guide
  - JOptionPane not a good idea for getting user input?
  - formatting problems in user's guide in table cells
  - Include John's upcoming plugin guide
  - document new edit server
  - document differences between web start and stand-alone version
- encoding option in VFS browser
- help viewer: links to .txt files?
- C+\
- docking improvements:
  - multiple instances of a dockable
  - make dockable menu items not be toggles.
    - if floating, open new instance.
    - if docked, go to existing instance, if not open, then open
  - create non-menu 'toggle' actions, for those who want them
  - each dockable has a close box in its tool bar; or a button that
    shows a menu, with commands for moving the dockable, making it
    floating, toggling auto-open, etc.
  - require that each dockable have a tool bar with a close button?
- plugins should be able to run arbitriary .bsh scripts easily
- next time i'm making an RPM, fix the shell script
- reload: preserve caret position
- globalColors setting:
  - tree controls, file system browser icons, tool bar icons look a bit
    ugly with different backgrounds
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
  - updateUI doesn't update tree colors
  - restart should not be necessary for 'globalColors' to take effect
- 'globalFont' property?
  - maybe don't give text fields a new font?...
- swing font customization

+ bugs that need to be fixed at some stage:

- Java 1.4 key events: DefaultInputHandler?
- XThis: don't throw exceptions for non-existent methods
- only exit delegates at the top level (eg <?php echo "<?xml ...?>" ?>
  in PHP)
- need to track down s.end < s.start cases
- vfs browser: >1 request error when clicking 'up'?
- italics font metrics bugs
- broken reverse search?
- text style bugs
- caret event not always fired
- prev line fold gutter bug
- tabbing to text area fails
- zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
- failed saves should not clear the dirty flag
- see if new beanshell fixes trailing \n bug
- get rid of final blank page of user's guide
- aborts not always fired
- fix dragStart handling in DockableWindowContainer.TabbedPane
- caret undo bugs
- folding paint up bug
- offsetToX() returning wrong location with some Java versions
- expand-fold too aggressive
- replace in sel doesn't work if rect

+ later:

- modes have a reference counter; unload modes which have no buffers open
- scrolling while caret is on a bracket over long distances slows things
  down
- status bar: show recording status, encoding, line separator?
- server property
- reuseview property
- background property
- macros in web start version
- scroll lock key toggles 'scroll mode'
- rewritten folding: Fold object, pointer to next of curr. level, each
  text area has visibility hashtable
- explicit folding
- fold browser
- when loading a plugin, check if all the jars are present?
- regexps in XMode
- improve handling of DIGIT sequences
- DELEGATE in EOL_SPAN
- reverse regexp search
- improved rectangular selections
- a 'reinsertOnNextLine' regexp for word wrap?
- soft wrap
- support Shift-clicks in JTextComponents (impossible?)
- support jEdit keyboard shortcuts in JTextComponents
- support middle mouse button clicks in JTextComponents
