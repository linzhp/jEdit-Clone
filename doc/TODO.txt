JEDIT TO DO

------- Stuff for 2.3pre1 -------

- Higlight.paintHighlight(): instead of passing y co-ordinate, pass a
  rectangle with line bounds. Maybe rework TextAreaPainter internals to
  use a rectangle also, it could simplify some things. If one rectangle
  instance is stored and reused, it would not slow things down
- HyperSearch - don't call matchesFound() on all buffers
- Save registers. Simple register.n properties
- Bookmarks and history window in help viewer
- Clean way of embedding token markers in one another, so that HTMLTokenMarker
  can be used to color PHP, ASP, VBScript, etc in addition to JavaScript
- Background colors for syntax tokens
- Integrate BufferTabs into the core
- Document EditBus in plugin development docs

------- Maybe later -------

- currently, Macros.java has a huge kudge to implement key bindings for
  macros. This is very stupid, and the menu code needs to be made more
  flexible, so that BeanShell and friends can also have shortcuts (that
  can be edited in the shortcuts option pane!)
- Menu bar model - plugins should be able to load menu bars for their own
  windows
- Macro recording is a crock of sh*t. Eg:
  C+ENTER 5 b c will give us "bbbbbc", but when recorded and played
  back, comes out as "bcbcbcbcbc". Also, find-next and other actions that
  record themselves "manually" cannot be repeated
- Word wrap
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Integrate XMode
- Enhanced printing:
  - print selection only
  - print line numbers option

------- Installer to do -------

- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization
- Bad file number I/O error - file descriptor leak somewhere?
