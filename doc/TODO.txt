JEDIT TO DO

2.5pre3:

- Divide by zero with JDK 1.3 in recalculateVisibleLines()
- Increase file chooser's preferred size
- Redo window-editor screenshots
- Abortable I/O
- Plugin manager: use swing centering code
- jEdit.getJARs() method
- EditPlugin.JAR class, with these methods:
  getClassLoader()
  getPath()
  getPlugins()
- Update plugin manager to use the above
- Editable toolbar
- Mode option pane for changing mode properties

2.5:

- Add macros to context menu and toolbar
- Annoying BufferTabs flicker
- Make HyperSearch a JFrame
- Improve FtpBrowser; add bookmarks, filtering, make it threaded, etc
- text area doesn't lose focus sometimes
- TokenMarker: MARK_PREVIOUS should mark to lastOffset not lastKeyword
- Plugin devel manual needs more work:
  - document views, edit panes, buffers
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - document VFS stuff
- Buffer tabs focus is still screwed with JDK 1.3
- Threaded HyperSearch
- set dirty to false when all undos undone

Later:

- Pluggable input handlers
- New document model
- Folding
- Word wrap
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?
- Improve markers -- next/prev-marker commands, highlight markers and
  registers in the gutter, buffer-local property to disable marker
  persistance
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
- Mode grammar editor

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
