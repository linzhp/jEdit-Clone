JEDIT TO DO

2.5:

- Update window-editor-* screenshots
- Can't follow symlinks in FTP browser
- -session= parameter should work even if files were specified on the
  command line
- Increase file chooser's preferred size
- Abortable I/O
- Annoying BufferTabs flicker
- Make HyperSearch a JFrame
- text area doesn't lose focus sometimes
- Documentation:
  - document macro syntax in more detail
  - document view, edit pane, buffer API
  - how to write text area and gutter hilites
  - write VFS developer docs
- Buffer tabs focus is still screwed with JDK 1.3

Later:

- Pluggable input handlers
- New document model
- Folding
- Word wrap
- Reverse search
- i18n support - bidi, input methods, localizable GUI, etc
- Maybe cursor beyond EOL?
- XML-driven auto indent?
- Improve markers -- next/prev-marker commands, highlight markers and
  registers in the gutter, buffer-local property to disable marker
  persistance
- XMode:
  - better error reporting
  - regexps
  - MARK_PREVIOUS should mark to lastOffset not lastKeyword
- Add macros to context menu and toolbar
- Improve FtpBrowser; add bookmarks, filtering, make it threaded, etc
- Mode grammar editor
- Set dirty to false when all undos undone (will be easy with new document
  model)
- Bracket matching code doesn't pay attention to comments, string literals,
  etc. It would be nice if its parser was a bit more intelligent

When we switch to Java 2:
- drag and drop
- Use collections
- Enhanced printing
