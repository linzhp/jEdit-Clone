TO DO

- FTP plugin: soft links???
- console: deleting backup files

+ before pre4:

- JavaInsight sets the mode but it gets set back to 'text'?
- update macro guide:
  - markers
  - mention registers?
  - s&r changes (removal of showSearchDialog(), beanshell replace)
  - new select API
  - convert to XML
- installing source for already installed plugins
- C+\
- help viewer: links to .txt files
- finish converting docs to xml
- fs browser: tooltips are shown in the wrong location
- non-existent files and caret history
- double click: selection prob
- double click should move caret to other bracket, not clicked one
- encoding option in VFS browser
- catch MalformedInputException and display a better error message
- get web start to work
- test edit server
- fold indicator in status
- 'globalFont' property?
  - maybe don't give text fields a new font?...

+ before 3.2final:

- support middle mouse button clicks in JTextComponents
- next time i'm making an RPM, fix the shell script
- support jEdit keyboard shortcuts in JTextComponents
- finish persistent splits: resize splits to make them in the middle
- replace in sel doesn't work if rect
- jEditLauncher
- Include John's upcoming plugin guide
- reload: preserve caret position
- globalColors setting:
  - add to global options
  - tree controls, file system browser icons, tool bar icons look a bit
    ugly with different backgrounds
  - help viewer looks ugly
  - selected borders in list, tree, table wrong colors
- swing font customization
- support Shift-clicks in JTextComponents (impossible?)
- 'appearance' option pane(s)?
- updateUI doesn't update tree colors
- restart should not be necessary for 'globalColors' to take effect

+ bugs that need to be fixed at some stage:

- Java 1.4 key events: DefaultInputHandler?
- XThis: don't throw exceptions for non-existent methods
- only exit delegates at the top level (eg <?php echo "<?xml ...?>" ?>
  in PHP)
- need to track down s.end < s.start cases
- vfs browser: >1 request error when clicking 'up'?
- italics font metrics bugs
- broken reverse search?
- text style bugs
- caret event not always fired
- prev line fold gutter bug
- tabbing to text area fails
- zlib decompression errors in plugin manager
- failed saves should not clear the dirty flag
- see if new beanshell fixes trailing \n bug
- get rid of final blank page of user's guide
- aborts not always fired
- fix dragStart handling in DockableWindowContainer.TabbedPane
- caret undo bugs
- folding paint up bug
- offsetToX() returning wrong location with some Java versions

+ later:

- modes have a reference counter; unload modes which have no buffers open
- scrolling while caret is on a bracket over long distances slows things
  down
- status bar: show recording status, encoding, line separator?
- server property
- reuseview property
- background property
- macros in web start version
- scroll lock key toggles 'scroll mode'
- rewritten folding: Fold object, pointer to next of curr. level, each
  text area has visibility hashtable
- explicit folding
- fold browser
- when loading a plugin, check if all the jars are present?
- regexps in XMode
- improve handling of DIGIT sequences
- DELEGATE in EOL_SPAN
- reverse regexp search
- improved rectangular selections
- a 'reinsertOnNextLine' regexp for word wrap?
- soft wrap
