JEDIT TO DO

- Integrate EditBus if enough plugins take advantage of it. This will also
  mean that jEdit will be able to take advantage of EditBus stuff; for
  example, the buffers menu could display which buffers have errors
- Do searching in a background thread. This will use the work request thread
  - For it to be fast, these methods would have to be thread safe:
    - jEdit.openFile()
    - jEdit.closeBuffer()
    - jEdit.getBuffer()
    - View.setBuffer()
    - JEditTextArea.select()
- Reverse search. Until gnu.regexp supports this, it can't be done very easily
- Integrate XMode
- Word wrap. True word-wrap would require significant changes to the text area,
  and would probably slow things down (think yToLine()). Maybe some sort of
  'soft wrap' that inserts newlines into the text could be implemented instead?

------- Installer -------

- Package and release
- Check version of existing 'simlaunch' program before overwriting
- Store human-readable strings in a property file for easier localization

------- Ideas for plugins -------

- Version control
- Project manager
- Application/applet/plugin wizard
- Localizations for specific languages
- Generic EditBus-aware plugin for invoking other programs inside the JVM
- Debugger front-end
- VI emulation
- Menu bar/right-click context menu/toolbar editor
- Spelling checker
