  jEdit works in a similar fashion to most MacOS or Windows text
  editors; if you have used one before, quickly skim this section to pick up
  the few jEdit-specific features. If you are more familiar with a
  Unix editor such as Emacs or VIM, read
  this section more carefully; Several things in jEdit are done differently
  from those text editors.

><P
>   The <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>caret</I

   To make changes to a buffer, the caret must first
   be moved to the location
   where the changes are to take place.
  </P
><P
>   The most direct way to move the caret is to click the
   mouse where you want it to be moved.

CLASS="KEYCAP"

CLASS="KEYCAP"

CLASS="KEYCAP"

   move the caret in the respective direction.

CLASS="KEYCAP"

> behave differently depending on
   how many times they are pressed, however if you wish them to behave like
   in other text editors (go to the start and end of the current line only),
   you can specify so in the
   <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Global Options</SPAN

   box; see <A

  </P
><P
>   The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Home</B
> key first moves the caret to the start of the
   current line, then to the top of the viewscreen, and then to the
   beginning of the buffer.
  </P
><P
>   The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>End</B
> key first moves the caret to the end of the
   current line, then to the bottom of the viewscreen, and then to the
   end of the buffer.
  </P
><P
>   The caret can also be moved directly to the beginning or end of the
   buffer by pressing <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
> in addition to
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Home</B
> or <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>End</B
>.
  </P
><P
>   The <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>PageUp</B
> and <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>PageDown</B
> keys move the caret up
   and down one viewscreen, respectively.
