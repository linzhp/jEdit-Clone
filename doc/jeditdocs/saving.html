   Any changes made to a buffer aren't actually stored to disk immediately
   (but see autosave below); instead, they are stored in the computer's high
   speed memory (RAM) until they are <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>saved</I
>.

    jEdit has an autosave feature that should protect
    against possible disasters, such as computer crashes.
    Every 15 seconds, all buffers with changes are
    written out to their respective file names, enclosed in hash
    ("#") characters. For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>program.c</TT
> will
    be autosaved to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>#program.c#</TT
>. These autosave files do
    not clutter up your disk; they are deleted when the buffer is explicitly
    saved.
    The point of autosaving is so that if jEdit crashes, it should be
    reasonably easy to recover your work - just open the autosave file(s)
    and copy over the autosaved data.
   </P

    Another useful safety feature is file backups. When you save a buffer
    for the first time after opening it, its original contents are
    saved to the buffer's file name suffixed with a tilde ("~").
    For example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>paper.tex</TT
> is backed up to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>paper.tex~</TT
>.
    The point of backups so that if you make extensive changes to a file, and then
    change your mind, you can go back to the previous version.

    The three major operating systems use different conventions to mark
    line endings in text files.
    The MacOS uses Carriage-Return (\r, ^M) for that purpose. Unix
    uses Newline (\n, ^J). DOS and Windows use Carriage-Return-Newline
    (\r\n, ^M^J). jEdit can handle all three file formats.
   </P
><P
>    When a file is loaded, jEdit tries to guess the line separators used
    in that file. When a file is being saved, it uses the line separator it
    found while loading the file. The line separator can be changed manually
    on a per-buffer
    basis in the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Utilities</SPAN
>&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"

    see <A

    It is useful after performing a CVS checkin or similar; CVS inserts
    version info in all files it commits, hence they must be re-read from
    disk.
