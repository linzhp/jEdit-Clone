>   In jEdit, most operations can be performed from the keyboard.
   Because there are quite a few commands, it would be very difficult to
   make them all accessible with one keystroke. So jEdit supports
   multiple keystroke bindings. To invoke a command with a multiple
   keystroke binding, all keystrokes have to be pressed, in order,
   with nothing in between.
  </P
><P
>   In this manual, key bindings are written in the form
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Modifier</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Key</B
>, where
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Modifier</B
> is the modifier key that must be pressed in
   addition to <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Key</B
> to invoke that command. When multiple
   keystrokes are present in a binding, they will be listed in order,
   for example the shortcut for <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Indent Selected Lines</SPAN
> is
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>E</B
>
   <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Control</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>I</B
>.
