<h1>The wonderful HelloEditBus plugin</h1>

This plugin demonstrates two aspects of the EditBus: receiving
notifications of jEdit events (in this case, we listen for buffers being
opened) and communication with another plugin (in this case, we send
errors to the ErrorList plugin using the ErrorSource API).
