<h2>Updating plugins</h2>

Plugins are very easy to update; the plugin manager feature can obtain
a list of updated plugins, and then download and install any that
interest you.<p>

To update your plugins now, make sure you are connected to the Internet
and click the button below. Note that plugins you update now will not be
usable immediately; you must restart jEdit first.<p>

You may update plugins at any other time by invoking the
<b>Plugins</b>&gt;<b>Plugin Manager</b> command.
If for some reason you have problems updating plugins using the plugin
manager, you can download and install them manually. Point your WWW
browser to <u><font color=blue>http://jedit.standmed.com</font></u> for
more information.
