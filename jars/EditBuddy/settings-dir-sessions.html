<h3>sessions</h3>

The <b>sessions</b> directory is for saved editor sessions. An editor
session is a list of open buffers and corresponding caret positions. The
session named "default" is saved when jEdit exits, and loaded when jEdit
starts. Additional sessions may be saved with the
<b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Save Session</b> command on jEdit's menu bar.
The complementary <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Load Session</b> command loads
saved sessions.
See Chapter 4 of the jEdit user guide for more information about
sessions.
