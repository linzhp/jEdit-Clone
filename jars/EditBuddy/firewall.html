<h2>Is your computer behind a firewall/proxy?</h2>

Certain jEdit features that make HTTP connections (plugin manager's
automated plugin installation and update, latest version check, loading
files from remote servers) will not function from behind a firewall unless
you configure the firewall settings. If you have a direct connection
to the Internet, you may skip this step by clicking <b>Next</b>.<p>

Firewall functionality is provided by the firewall plugin, which requires
Java 2. To configure the plugin, click the button below. If you chose not
to install the firewall plugin when installing jEdit, or you are not
running Java 2, the button will be disabled and firewall functionality
will not be available.

<param name="editAction" value="edit-buddy-firewall-config">
<param name="dependsOnPlugin" value="FirewallPlugin">
</object>
</center>

You may change firewall settings at any other time by invoking the
<b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Global Options</b> command from jEdit's menu bar
and selecting <b>Plugin Settings</b>&gt;<b>Firewall</b> from the
resulting dialog box.
