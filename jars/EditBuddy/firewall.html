<h2>Is your computer behind a firewall/proxy?</h2>

If you have a direct connection
to the Internet, you may skip this step by clicking <b>Next</b>.<p>

Certain jEdit features that make HTTP connections (plugin manager's
automated plugin installation and update, latest version check, loading
files from remote servers) will not function from behind a firewall unless
you configure the firewall settings.<p>

To configure firewall settings, click the button below. If you chose not
to install the firewall plugin when installing jEdit, or you are not
running Java 2, the button will be disabled and firewall functionality
will not be available.<p>

You may change firewall settings at any other time by invoking the
<b>Global Options</b> command from the <b>Utilities</b> menu
and selecting <b>Plugin Settings</b>&gt;<b>Firewall</b> from the
resulting dialog box.
