<h3>cache</h3>

jEdit caches directory listings from remote FTP servers in the
<b>cache</b> directory for improved performance. This directory
is emptied when jEdit exits. You can clear the cache at any other
time by selecting the <b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Clear Remote Directory
Cache</b> command from jEdit's menu bar.
