	Because the plugin API changes over time, older plugins might have\n\
	problems running under newer jEdit releases. Therefore, it is a good\n\
	idea to update your plugins to their latest versions after installing\n\
	a new version of jEdit.<p>\n\
	\n\
	This wizard will offer to update your plugins, and give pointers to\n\
	what is new in this jEdit release.\n\
