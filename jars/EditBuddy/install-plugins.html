<h2>Installing plugins</h2>

While jEdit is very useful on its own, it can be made even more
powerful by installing "plugins". Plugins are modules of code
that add features to jEdit.<p>

Plugins are very easy to install; the plugin manager feature can obtain
a list of available plugins, and then download and install any that
interest you.<p>

To install some plugins now, make sure you are connected to the Internet
and click the button below. Note that plugins you install now will not be
usable immediately; you must restart jEdit first.

<object classid="org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.HTMLActionButton">
<param name="text" value="Install some plugins">
<param name="editAction" value="edit-buddy-plugin-install">
<param name="dependsOnPlugin" value="PluginManagerPlugin">
</object>
</center>

You may install plugins at any other time by invoking the
<b>Plugins</b>&gt;<b>Plugin Manager</b> command from jEdit's menu bar.
If for some reason you have problems installing plugins using the plugin
manager, you can download and install them manually. Point your WWW
browser to <u><font color=blue>http://jedit.standmed.com</font></u> for
more information.
