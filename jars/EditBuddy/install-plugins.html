<h2>Installing plugins</h2>

Plugins are third-party modules of code that add features to jEdit.
Plugins are very easy to install; the plugin manager feature can obtain
a list of available plugins from a server, and then download and install
any that interest you.<p>

To install some plugins now, make sure your Internet connection is up
and click the button below. Note that plugins you install now will not be
usable immediately; you must restart jEdit first.<p>

You may install plugins at any other time by invoking the
<b>Plugins</b>&gt;<b>Plugin Manager</b> command.
If for some reason you have problems installing plugins using the plugin
manager, you can download and install them manually. Point your WWW
browser to <u><font color=blue>http://jedit.standmed.com</font></u> for
more information.
