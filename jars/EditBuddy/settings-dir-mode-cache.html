<h3>mode-cache</h3>

The <b>mode-cache</b> file stores
information about all available edit modes so that they can be loaded
on demand. The mode cache must be rebuilt with the
<b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Reload Edit Modes</b> command on jEdit's menu bar
if edit modes are added or removed. See Chapter 5 of the jEdit user
guide for more information about edit modes.
