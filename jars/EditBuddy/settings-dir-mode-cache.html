<h3>mode-cache</h3>

The <b>mode-cache</b> file stores
information about all available edit modes so that they can be loaded
on demand. After adding or remove edit modes, the mode cache must be rebuilt
by invoking the
<b>Utilities</b>&gt;<b>Reload Edit Modes</b> command. See Chapter 4 of the
jEdit user
guide for more information about edit modes.
