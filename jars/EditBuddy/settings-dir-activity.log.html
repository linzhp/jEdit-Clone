<h3>activity.log</h3>

The <b>activity.log</b> file contains the full text of the activity log.
jEdit writes all errors, debugging information, and so on, to the
activity log. The last 500 lines can be viewed from within jEdit
by invoking <b>View Activity Log</b> from the <b>Utilities</b> menu.
Because of buffering done for performance reasons, the activity log file
on disk may not always be up to date. To force it to be written out
fully, invoke <b>Update Activity Log on Disk</b> from the <b>Utilities</b>
menu. Note that when jEdit exits, it automatically performs this step.
See appendix B of the jEdit
user guide for more information about the activity log.
